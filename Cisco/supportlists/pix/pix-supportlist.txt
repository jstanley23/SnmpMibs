PIX Firewall MIB Support List
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The lists below indicate which MIBs and SNMP traps are supported by the
PIX Firewall. Depending on the version of the software, different MIBs and
traps are supported. 

SNMP version 1 MIB files are in the v1 directory and SNMP version 2 MIB
files are in the v2 directory.  Note that for most every MIB in the v2
directory, there exists a SNMP version 1 conversion of the MIB in the v1
directory as well. The corresponding schema files for SunNet Manager can
be found in the schema directory. OID (Object Identifier) files for 
SunNet Manager can be found in the oid directory. Trap files 
for SunNet Manager can be found in the traps directory.

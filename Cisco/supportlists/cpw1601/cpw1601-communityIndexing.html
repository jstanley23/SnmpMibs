<h1>Community String Indexing</h1>
<hr>

Some standard MIBs assume that a particular SNMP entity only contains one
instance of the MIB.  Thus the standard MIB does not have any index which
would allow one to directly access a particular instance of the MIB.  In 
these cases we provide community string indexing to access each instance 
of the standard MIB.  The syntax is [community string]@[instance number].
<p>

For example, the Catalyst switch includes one instance of the standard
BRIDGE-MIB for each Virtual LAN in the switch. If the read-only community
string is "public" and the read-write community string is "private", one 
could use "public@25" to read the BRIDGE-MIB for VLAN 25 and use
"private@33" to read and write the BRIDGE-MIB for VLAN 33.  If just 
"public" or "private" is used, the BRIDGE-MIB for VLAN 1 is accessed.
<p>

Also note that community string indexing does not affect access to MIBs
which have only one instance.  Thus "public@25" can be used to access
RFC1213-MIB at the same time BRIDGE-MIB for VLAN 25 is being accessed.

The below MIBs are supported by the Catalyst 2600 Token Ring switch.  SNMP
version 1 MIBs are in the v1 directory and SNMP version 2 MIBs are in
the v2 directory.  Note that for most every MIB <foo>.my in the v2
directory, there exists a SNMP version 1 conversion of the MIB
<foo>-V1SMI.my in the v1 directory.  The exception is SNMPv2-TC.my.
Thanks go to David T. Perkins for his package smicng which was used to
produce most of the v1 conversions.

    RFC1213-MIB.my
    RFC1231-MIB.my

    ETHERLIKE-MIB.my

<h1>Community String Indexing</h1>
<hr>

Some standard MIBs assume that a particular SNMP entity only contains one
instance of the MIB.  Thus the standard MIB does not have any index which
would allow one to directly access a particular instance of the MIB.  In
these cases we provide community string indexing to access each instance
of the standard MIB.  The syntax is [community string]@[instance number|context].
<p>

<b>[community string]@[instance number]</b>
<p>

For example, the Catalyst switch includes one instance of the standard
BRIDGE-MIB for each Virtual LAN in the switch. If the read-only community
string is "public" and the read-write community string is "private", one
could use "public@25" to read the BRIDGE-MIB for VLAN 25 and use
"private@33" to read and write the BRIDGE-MIB for VLAN 33.  If just
"public" or "private" is used, the BRIDGE-MIB for VLAN 1 is accessed.
<p>

Traps sent from a mib that is indexed by community string also indicate
which instance of the mib it corresponds to by using community string
indexing.  For example, a newRoot trap from the BRIDGE-MIB for VLAN 25
would have a community string of "public@25" assuming the read-only
community string is "public".
<p>

Also note that community string indexing does not affect access to MIBs
which have only one instance.  Thus "public@25" can be used to access
RFC1213-MIB at the same time BRIDGE-MIB for VLAN 25 is being accessed.
<p>

Another example for the Catalyst switches is the SNMP-REPEATER-MIB.  To
access this MIB for a particular repeater in the Catalyst switch, use
[community string]@[module number/port number].  For example, if the
read-only community string is "public", one could use "public@3/1" to
read the SNMP-REPEATER-MIB for the repeater attached to port 1 on module 3.
<p>

<b>[community string]@[context]</b>
<p>

New options for the [context] described above have been added. The
new options are snmp contexts. There are currently five context prefixes:
"vlan-", "mistp-", "mod/port-", "mod-" and "mst-". In most cases, the text
following the prefix would be a number. However, for the "mod/port-" case,
it would be "#/#", representing the module and port.
<p>

The list of all available snmp contexts currently available on a switch can
be obtained by issuing the command "show snmp context" on the console.

Index Context<br>
----- --------<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp0 <br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1 vlan-1<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2 vlan-1002<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp3 vlan-1003<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp4 vlan-1004<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp5 vlan-1005<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp6 mst-2<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp7 mst-3<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp8 mod-7<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp9 mod-8<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp10 mod-10/1<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp11 mod-10/13<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp12 mod-10/25<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp13 mod-10/27<br>
</font>
<p>

For example, in order to access a MIB for the vlan-1002 context, with the
community string "public", one could use "public@vlan-1002".

The below MIBs are supported by IOS version 10.2 and later.  SNMP
version 1 MIBs are in the v1 directory and SNMP version 2 MIBs are in
the v2 directory.  Note that for most every MIB <foo>.my in the v2
directory, there exists a SNMP version 1 conversion of the MIB
<foo>-V1SMI.my in the v1 directory.  The exception is SNMPv2-TC.my.
Thanks go to David T. Perkins for his package smicng which was used to
produce most of the v1 conversions.

At a minimum, you will want to download all of the OLD-CISCO- and CISCO-
mibs (including -TC and -SMI) for your network management workstation.

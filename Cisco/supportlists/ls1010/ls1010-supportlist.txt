The below MIBs are supported by the LS1010 in release 11.1 and later.
SNMP version 1 MIBs are in the v1 directory and SNMP version 2 MIBs are
in the v2 directory.  Note that for most every MIB <foo>.my in the v2
directory, there exists a SNMP version 1 conversion of the MIB
<foo>-V1SMI.my in the v1 directory.  The exception is SNMPv2-TC.my.
Thanks go to David T. Perkins for his package smicng which was used to
produce most of the v1 conversions.

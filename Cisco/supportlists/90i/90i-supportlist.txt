Cisco 90i Support Lists


SNMP version 1 MIBs are in the v1 directory and SNMP version 2 MIBs are in the v2 directory. Note that for most every 
MIB .my in the v2 directory, there exists a SNMP version 1 conversion of the MIB -V1SMI.my in the v1 directory. The 
exception is SNMPv2-TC.my. Thanks go to David T. Perkins for his package smicng which was used to produce most of the v1 
conversions. 

At a minimum, you will want to download all of the OLD-CISCO- and CISCO- mibs (including -TC and -SMI) for your network 
management workstation.

The value written is the name of the file to load.  The instance id is
the IP address of the TFTP server host (or 255.255.255.255 to
broadcast the request).

The netConfigSet and writeNet objects work the same way.

NOTE:  There is an important difference between netConfigSet and
hostConfigSet.  A set to hostConfigSet causes all line parameters to
be reset to factory defaults after loading but before parsing the
config file.  A set to netConfigSet does not cause the line parameters
to be reset.

For example, to load the file "cisco-config" from the server at
10.1.2.3, set

        hostConfigSet.10.1.2.3

to

        "cisco-config"

         The individual characters in this name may be alphanumeric  
         characters, forward slashes, backward slashes, periods, 
         dashes, and underscores, but no embedded spaces.   
         Also, the last character of the name must not be a 
         dash or a forward slash. 
        
         The default value for this MIB object is a 'null'.   
         If the Announcement file server name is not configured,  
         Announcements cannot be downloaded. 
           
         The 'null' value of this field is a single space character,  
         which may be set to this value by setting this MIB object to 
         the single character space string (' ').   
         Alternatively, for computing systems that cannot handle 
         single character space strings, the single character 
         ('_') underscore string may be used as an alternative  
         'null' value, which would then be converted internally to  
         the single character space string. 
        
         Before the Announcement file server name may be successfully  
         configured, the name must first be added to the list of 
         domain names (mgDomainName) contained in the  
         mgDomainNameTable(defined in CISCO-WAN-MG-MIB MIB).   
         If the domain is configured for internal resolution, then  
         the file server name must be asssigned an IP address 
         to be put in the mgcResolutionTable(defined in  
         CISCO-WAN-MG-MIB MIB)."

        The 'null' value of this field is a single space character,

        An entry is added to the table by the agent when the
        beacon report sent by the client arrives at the dot11
        interface of an AP.  An existing entry for a client
        gets over-written when the subsequent reports arrive
        at an AP from that client.  The term 'client' here
        refers to all the wireless CCX compliant devices like
        mobile stations, tags etc.

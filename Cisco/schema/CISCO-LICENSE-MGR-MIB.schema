        The procedure for modifying the above three objects are 
        as follows:
        1. Determine new values for clmLicenseFileURI, 
        clmLicenseFileTargetName and clmLicenseConfigCommand.
        
        2. Retrieve the value of clmLicenseConfigSpinLock.

        clmLicenseFileURI to the new value. If the set fails for 
        the clmLicenseConfigSpinLock object, go back to step 2.
        
        4. Set the value of clmLicenseConfigSpinLock to the
        retrieved value incremented by one, and (in the same PDU) 
        the value of clmLicenseFileTargetName to its new value. If 
        the set fails for clmLicenseConfigSpinLock, go back to 
        step 2.
        
        5. Set the value of clmLicenseConfigSpinLock to the
        retrieved value incremented by two, and (in the same PDU) 
        the value of clmLicenseConfigCommand to 'install' or 
        'uninstall' or 'update'. If the set fails for 
        clmLicenseConfigSpinLock, go back to step 2.
        
        Note that if it's possible to include 
        clmLicenseFileTargetName and/or clmLicenseConfigCommand in 
        the (Set Request) PDU of an earlier step, then step 4

        to 'install' or 'update'.
        For uninstall operation the value of this object is not

		readwrite octet[31]	clmLicenseFileTargetName

        license file will be installed, or the name of the license 
        file for uninstall, or the name of the license file to be 
        updated.
        
        For 'uninstall' operation, this object must be set to the
        appropriate value, i.e., a non-zero length string, before 
        or concurrently with setting the value of 
        clmLicenseConfigCommand object to 'uninstall'.
        
        For 'install' operation, this object is set either to the
        file name with which the license will be installed, or to
        the zero-length string.  In the latter case, the filename
        specified through clmLicenseFileURI will be used for 
        installing the license.
        For example, if the value of clmLicenseFileURI object is 
        set to 'bootflash:licfile1.lic' and this object is set to
        'target1.lic', then the license will be installed  
        with the filename 'target1.lic'. 
        If this object contains zero length string then license 
        will be installed with the filename 'licfile1.lic'.
        
        For 'update' operation, this object is set either to the
        file name which is to be updated (overwritten), or to
        the zero-length string.  In the latter case, the filename
        specified through clmLicenseFileURI, will be updated.
        For example, if the value of clmLicenseFileURI object is 
        set to 'bootflash:licfile2.lic' and this object is set to
        'target2.lic', then the already installed license file  
        'target2.lic' will be updated by the contents of 
        'bootflash:licfile2.lic'.
        If this object contains zero length string then the 
        already installed license file 'licfile2.lic' will be
        updated with the contents of 'bootflash:licfile2.lic'."

		description 	"This object is used to configure a PVC protection
         group (or redundant group) with the PVCs protecting
         each other. Currently only two PVCs are supported
         in a protection group. One of them is primary and
         the other one is secondary. This is intended for
         PVCs designated to carry control traffic and needs
         to be protected. However the same PVC may also be
         used to carry VoIP bearer traffic or other traffic. 
        
         Channels that are 'protected (1)' share the 
         following characteristics:
        
         1. They are monitored for their health (including
            emission of traps in case of state changes).
        
         2. An active channel is protected by another
            protected channel which is standby. This means
            when an active channel fails, switchover to 
            another channel will happen if one is available. 
        
         3. It is also possible to do a forced switchover
            (through locking). Even in the case of forced
            switchover, switchover to another channel, which
            is in standby, will happen.
        
         4. Channels may be locked to force switchover and/or
            to take the channel out of service in a graceful 
            fashion.
        
         This object takes the default value of 'unprotected (2)'
         during the creation of the table entry. Once the
         primary and secondary channels have been created as 
         'unprotected (2)' channels, they can be 'protected (1)'
         by doing a SET on the primary channel by specifying
         the vismChanProtection as protected and by specifying
         the vismChanFallbackLcn as the LCN number of the
         secondary channel. 
        
         The sequence of operations for setting up the 
         'protection (1)' group is:
           step 1: Add primary channel as unprotected
           step 2: Add secondary channel as unprotected.
                   The PCR value for the secondary should be
                   the same as that of the primary.
           step 3: Do a SET on the primary channel with
                   vismChanProtection set to 'protected (1)'
                   and vismChanFallbackLcn set to the 
                   LCN number of the secondary channel. This 
                   operation sets-up the protection group. The
                   primary channel becomes active and the
                   secondary channel becomes standby. 
        
         Please note that all the CAC related parameters
         for the both the PVCs in the protecting group
         should be same. In other words the vismChanCacMaster,
         vismChanCarrierLossPolicy, vismChanCacRejectionPolicy,
         VAD tolerance  etc.. should have the same value
         for the PVCs that are protecting each other, else
         the set request to protect two channels will
         be rejected.
        
         Once the protection group is setup, if the active
         channel fails, it automatically switches over to
         the standby. The standby channel then becomes
         active.
        
         The channels can be removed from the protection 
         group by setting this object to unprotected. 
        
         Deletion of a 'protected (1)' channel is not
         allowed. Channels have to be removed from
         the protection group first before deleting. The
         sequence of operations for deleting 'protected (1)'
         channels are:
             step 1: Remove the  channels from the
                     protection group by setting 
                     vismChanProtection to unprotected.
             step 2: Delete secondary channel.
             step 3: Delete primary channel."

                      Whether a switchover to a channel is 
                      allowed or not is dependent on both
                      vismChanActivityState and vismChanLockingState.

		readwrite int	vismVCCI
		description 	"The VCCI, or Virtual Circuit Connection
         Identifier, is a variable that identifies a
         virtual circuit connection between two nodes. 
         A virtual circuit connection, or  VCC, consists of
         one virtual circuit link or a series of concatenated
         virtual circuit links. In its most common usage,
         the value  of the VCCI is unique between the nodes
         at the extremities of the virtual circuit
         connection, but not on a network-wide basis. Hence,
         its value needs to be qualified by the ATM 
         addresses of these end nodes. At one of these 
         end nodes, its value needs to be qualified by the
         ATM address of the far-end node. Some applications
         can extend this definition to make the VCCI value
         unique on a network-wide basis. This is specially
         possible when VCCIs are administered from a management
         system and not locally assigned  by a node.
        
         In this MIB, the VCCI serves as a label to be assigned
         by an external application. VCCIs need to be unique
         for a given remote peer, however, the same VCCI can
         be reused for different remote peers. Accordingly,
         the combination of (remote address, VCCI) will always
         be unique for any given agent. This allows a controller 
         to refer to a VC by the VCCI and remote peer address,
         in contrast to VPI/VCI and port. It thus constitutes
         a convenience feature, providing an alternative
         identification scheme for a VC which is managed by
         an outside user, such as a management system.  
        
         The remote peer address can be specified in NSAP, 
         E.164, or GWID format, as indicated by the address
         type (vismRemoteAddressType). Depending on the
         address type specified, uniqueness will be relative 
         to NSAP, E.164 address, or GWID. 
        
         It is recommended not to change the value of this
         object once it has been created. However, 
         upon modification, it will be ensured that the
         resulting combination of VCCI and remote address
         is unique. Requests that would result in a
         non-unique combination will be rejected.
         Beyond this, there are no other integrity constraints
         that will be enforced for this object. This includes
         network-level consistency whether the remote peer,
         or an external controller, use the same VCCI
         designation for the VC."

        in the wireless services hierarchy and acts as both
        the Infrastructure and Mobile Node Authenticator.
        For an infrastructure node for which

        mode of operation is always 'adminStandAlone' as it
        is the highest level node in the wireless services
        hierarchy.  An infrastructure node whose
        cDot11csServiceType is 'wds' can be in
        'adminStandAlone' mode if there is no node offering
        Wireless Network Services and is the root node in
        the wireless services hierarchy.  An infrastructure
        node for which the value of cDot11csServiceType is
        'wns' can't be in 'adminStandAlone' mode since it
        always has another infrastructure node as its parent
        for which the value of cDot11csServiceType is
        'rootWns' and won't be the root node in the wireless
        services hierarchy.
        
        infrastructure  - An infrastructure node in this
        mode has been configured with an external IN
        Authenticator.  The external IN Authenticator
        in this case is the infrastructure node whose value
        of cDot11csServiceType is 'rootWns'.  The immediate
        parent of this infrastructure node is given by the
        object cDot11csParentNodeAddress.
        
        fallbackStandAlone - This infrastructure node has
        been configured to function in the 'infrastructure'
        mode but the node has dropped back to
        'fallbackStandAlone' mode due to loss of
        communication with its parent node.  From an
        operational point of view, 'fallbackStandAlone' mode
        is  same as 'adminStandAlone' mode.  However, in the
        'fallbackStandAlone' mode, an infrastructure node
        continuously attempts to get back to the

        A value of goActive will cause the immediate transition to
        the active state.
        
        A value of noAction will cause no such transition.  Instead,
        the transition to the active state will occur normally when
        the current quiet period has expired.
        
        Going active immediately incurs extra routing protocol
        overhead, but allows a fresh set of routing updates be
        exchanged each time the line is brought up.  This is useful
        in a Dial-on-Demand routing environment.

        Specifies the order position of a new ACE before a ACE which
        is already in the ACL. It means that the new ACE will replace
        the position of the ACE which the object specifies.
        
        For example, if there are 6 ACEs in an ACL, so the positions
        of those 6 ACEs will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. If the user would
        like to add a new ACE and he specifies 4 to be the value of
        this object, the old ACEs in positions, 4, 5, 6 will become
        5, 6, 7 while the entry containing the new ACE is active.
        The removing is similar. Be careful, for example, if the
        user would like to move an ACE whose position is 2 to before
        the ACE whose position is 5. He put the status of that entry
        to in-active and the position order will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
        The old ACEs in positions 3, 4, 5, 6 becomes 2, 3, 4, 5. So,
        the user has to specify the object to 4, because the ACE in
        old position 5 has been moved to position 4.
        
        If not specified, the default value 0 will be used. And the
        new ACE is appended to the end of the ACL. 0 will be always
        returned if the status of this row is active. If the entry

## Group and Table Declarations

	table	cbgpRouteTable
	description "This table contains information about routes to
        destination networks from all BGP4 peers.  Since 
        BGP4 can carry routes for multiple Network Layer 
        protocols, this table has the Address Family 
        Identifier(AFI) of the Network Layer protocol as the 
        first index. Further for a given AFI, routes carried
        by BGP4 are distinguished based on Subsequent Address 
        Family Identifiers(SAFI).  Hence that is used as the
        second index.  Conceptually there is a separate Loc-RIB
        maintained by the BGP speaker for each combination of 
        AFI and SAFI supported by it."

## Group and Table Declarations

	table	cwmConfigTable
	description "This table contains objects required for configuring module
         specific parameters. These parameters may be related to the
         hardware specific parameters which can affect the
         ATM Connection characteristics."

		readwrite gauge	cwmIngressSCTFileId
		description 	"The file ID of the Service Class Template(SCT) file. The SCT
         holds the connection specific parameters for this module in
         the ingress direction(From Network to the Switch).
        
         Terminologies used:
         SCT : Service Class Template
          The Service Class Template ( or Service Template or SCT )
          provides a means for inferring extended parameters, which 
          are generally platform-specific, from the set of standard
          ATM protocol parameters passed in VSI(Virtual Switch Interface)
          connection setup primitives. A set of Service Templates are
          available in a non-volatile storage and is downloaded onto
          each Service Module on power up.
        
          In general, SCTs contain two classes of data. One class consists
          of parameters necessary to establish a Virtual Connection
          (i.e. Per-VC) and includes entries such as UPC(Usage Parameter Control)
          actions, various bandwidth-related items, per-VC thresholds,
          and some hardware-specific items.The second class of data items
          includes those necessary to configure the associated 
          Class-of-Service Buffers that provide the QoS support."

         In case of a line alarm, enabling this feature temporarily
         suspends traffic in both direction and starts local loop-back

		description 	"The Configured version of the Service Class Template(SCT)
        file. This version applies to both the card SCT and the port
        SCT files in a service module.
        
        The port SCT files are specified while provisioning a port using
        the caviFileId field in the CISCO-WAN-VIRTUAL-IF-MIB.my MIB.
        The card SCT file is specifed in this MIB using the 
        cwmIngressSCTFileName object.
        
        The configured version of the SCT does not take effect until
        the service module is rebooted. However, graceful invocation
        of a new SCT version can be achieved by using redundant service
        modules. The configured SCT version is first applied on a standby
        service module by rebooting it. When the standby reboots, it 
        comes up with the configured SCT version. Thereafter a switchover
        can be performed, making the standby SM take over as active."

        have been done on configuration of a card.
        
        The use of this object is implementation specific.
        This requires the NMS application saving the previous
        value of this object and compare it later for finding
        any changes in the card.
        
        The upload counter is incremented in, for instance:
        
        - any physical interface characteristics are modified.
        - any logical interface is added/deleted/modified.
        - any IMA Group/MFR bundle is added/deleted/modified.

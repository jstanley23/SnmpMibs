## Group and Table Declarations

	table	sdlcPortAdminTable
	description "This table contains objects that can be
        changed to manage an SDLC port.    Changing one
        of these parameters may take effect in the
        operating port immediately or may wait until
        the interface is restarted depending on the
        details of the implementation.
        
        Most of the objects in this read-write table
        have corresponding read-only objects in the
        sdlcPortOperTable that return the current
        operating value.
        
        The operating values may be different from
        these configured values if  a configured
        parameter was changed after the interface was
        started."

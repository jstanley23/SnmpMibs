        1. ensures the Edit Buffer for a management domain is empty,
        i.e., there are no rows in this table for this management
        domain.

        to its own identifier (e.g., its own IP address).

        information in the vtpVlanEditTable.
        
        4. if and when the edited information is to be instantiated,
        issues a SNMP set operation which sets vtpVlanEditOperation
        to 'apply'.
        
        5. issues retrieval requests to obtain the value of
        vtpVlanApplyStatus, until the result of the apply is
        determined.

        on(1) dictates that the interface will always be a
        trunk. This is the value for static entries (those that
        show no dynamic behavior). If the negotiation is supported
        on this port, negotiation will take place with the far end
        to attempt to bring the far end into trunking state.
        
        off(2) allows an operator to specify that the specified
        interface is never to be trunk, regardless of any dynamic
        mechanisms to the contrary.  This value is useful for
        overriding the default behavior of some switches. If the
        negotiation is supported on this port, negotiation will take
        place with the far end to attempt on the link to bring the
        far end into non-trunking state.
        
        desirable(3) is used to indicate that it is desirable for
        the interface to become a trunk.  The device will initiate
        any negotiation necessary to become a trunk but will not
        become a trunk unless it receives confirmation from the far
        end on the link.
        
        auto(4) is used to indicate that the interface is capable
        and willing to become a trunk but will not initiate
        trunking negotiations.  The far end on the link are
        required to either start negotiations or start sending
        encapsulated packets, on which event the specified
        interface will become a trunk.
        
        onNoNegotiate(5) is used to indicate that the interface is

        place with the far end on the link to ensure consistent

	table	vtpAuthenticationTable
	description "The table contains the authentication information of VTP
        in which the local system participates.
        
        The security mechanism of VTP relies on a secret key
        that is used to alter the MD5 digest of the packets
        transmitted on the wire.  The secret value is
        created from a password that may be saved in plain text
        in the configuration or hidden from the configuration.
        
        The device creating or modifying the VTP configuration
        signs it using the MD5 digest generated from the secret
        key before advertising it. Other devices in the domain
        receive this configuration use the same secret key
        to accept it if correctly signed or drop it otherwise.
        
        The user has the option to hide the password from the
        configuration. Once the password is hidden, the secret
        key generated from the password is shown in the 
        configuration instead, and there is no other way to 
        show the password in plain text again but clearing 
        it or resetting it. 
        
        In an un-trusted area, the password on a device can 
        be configured without being unveiled. After that,
        it has to be provided again by setting the same 
        value to vtpDatabaseTakeOverPassword if the user 
        wants to take over the whole VTP management domain
        of the database type.
        
        When managementDomainVersionInUse is version3(4), the 
        authentication mechanism is common to all VTP
        database type."

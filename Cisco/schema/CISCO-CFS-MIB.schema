## Group and Table Declarations

	description "This table lists all the CFS capable features in the local
         device.
        
         The table provides control, actions, current operating
         state information and last action result information for
         CFS capable features.
        
         Each entry in this table represents a CFS capable feature.
         An entry in the table is created by the agent when CFS
         capable feature registers with CFS infrastructure. The
         agent removes the entry from the table when the CFS
         capable de-registers with CFS infrastructure. Management
         application can not create new entry in this table.

## Group and Table Declarations

	table	cvacmSecurityToGroupTable
	description "An Extension table to the 'vacmSecurityToGroupTable'
         defined in 'SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB. 
         
         This table provides a mechanism to map a combination 
         of 'securityModel' and 'securityName' into one or more
         groups in addition to the 'vacmGroupName' mapped in
         the 'vacmSecurityToGroupTable'. These groups provide 
         additional access control policies for a principal.
         
         The agent must allow the same group mapping entry to be
         present in both  the 'cvacmSecurityToGroupTable' and the
         'vacmSecurityToGroupTable'.            
         
         A row in this table can not exist without a corresponding
         row for the same combination of 'securityModel' and
         'securityName in the 'vacmSecurityToGroupTable'.
         
         While creating a row in this table, if there is no
         corresponding row for the same combination of
         'securityModel' and 'securityName in the 
         'vacmSecurityToGroupTable', the same  mapping entry in 
         is created in the  'vacmSecurityToGroupTable' by the
         agent using the values of instance variables of the entry
         in this table. 
        
         The deletion of a row in the 'vacmSecurityToGroupTable'
         also causes the deletion of all the group mapping 
         entries for the same combination of  'vacmSecurityModel' 
         and 'vacmSecurityName' in the 'cvacmSecurityToGroupTable'.
         The deletion of a row in this table does not affect
         'vacmSecurityToGroupTable'entries.

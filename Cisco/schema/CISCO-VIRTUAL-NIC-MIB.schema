	table	cvnPinningTable
	description "A list of virtual ethernet interfaces which supports
        pinning functionality in VSM.
        
        Pinning is a mechanism of directing traffic to or
        from a interface through a particular interface
        in a switch.
        
        By default, system use load balancing algorithm to pick
        the best possible physical interface automatically.
        However, user may use pinning functionality to
        instrument the finite control on the traffic flow
        between virtual ethernet interfaces and actual physical
        interfaces in VSM.
        
        For example, user may want to configure that packets
        from a particular virtual ethernet interface always go
        out through first interface in the port channel
        irrespective of load balancing policy on the switch.
        In order to achieve this, user can pin the virtual
        ethernet interface to first interface of the switch."

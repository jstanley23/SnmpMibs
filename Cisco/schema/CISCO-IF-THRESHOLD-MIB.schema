        exponent of 10, times the value of ifSpeed (if the value of
        ifSpeed is less than the maximum value) or ifHighSpeed

        all thresholds in the template are de-activated on this
        interface and there is no corresponding entry in the
        cifthIfThresholdFiredTable, regardless of whether any of the
        thresholds in the template are being exceeded on this
        interface.
        
        One reason for a template not to be operational on an
        interface to which it is assigned is when the interface has two
        (or more) templates assigned to it that contain thresholds on
        the same object with the same severity and direction, i.e.,
        thresholds with the same values of cifthThresholdObject,
        cifthThresholdSeverity, and cifthThresholdDirection.  This may
        occur when a template is assigned to the interface, or when a
        threshold is added to a template that is already active on the
        interface.  When this occurs, the implementation may operate on
        both (or all) threshold values, or it may take down one (or
        more) of the templates on this interface, which is indicated by
        changing the value of this object from 'up' to 'down'."

        A new entry can only be created when there is an active entry
        in the cifthTemplateTable with the same value of
        cifthTemplateIndex.
        
        When an entry is activated, the thresholds in this template
        (identified by cifthTemplateIndex) are activated on this
        interface, with the following exception:  If a threshold is
        defined on an object that does not have an instance for this

        de-activated on this interface and the corresponding entry in
        the cifthIfThresholdFiredTable is deleted, if it exists.
        
        After the entry has been activated, this object cannot be set

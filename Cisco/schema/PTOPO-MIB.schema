## Group and Table Declarations

	table	ptopoConnTable
	description "This table contains one or more rows per physical network
        connection known to this agent.  The agent may wish to
        ensure that only one ptopoConnEntry is present for each
        local port, or it may choose to maintain multiple
        ptopoConnEntries for the same local port.
        
        Entries based on lower numbered identifier types are
        preferred over higher numbered identifier types, i.e., lower
        values of the ptopoConnRemoteChassisType and
        ptopoConnRemotePortType objects."

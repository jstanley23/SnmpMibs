		readwrite octet[255]	cvDnisMappingUrl
		description 	"The url specifies a file location. The file contains
         individual DNIS entries that belong to the DNIS map 
         name specified by cvDnisMappingName.
        
         Once a url is created and associated with a map name (the
         association is complete when the row is made active(1)),
         it cannot be modified while cvDnisMappingStatus is
         active. If a different url needs to be associated with
         the current map name, the row status should be made
         notInService(2) and this object has to be modified to
         associate a new url. When a new association is made all
         the DNIS entries corresponding to the old association
         will be deleted from the cvDnisNodeTable.
        
         The url is read when the row status is made active(1) or
         when the row status is active and the object 
        cvDnisMappingRefresh is explicitly set to refresh(2). 
        If the url is not accessible then a

         file specified by cvDnisMappingUrl, this object can be
         set to refresh(2). This will cause the contents of the
         file to be re-read and correspondingly update the
         cvDnisNodeTable. After the completion of this operation,
         the value of this object is reset to idle(1). The only
         operation allowed on this object is setting it to
         refresh(2). This can only be done when the current value
         is idle(1) and the rowstatus is active(1).

                      can modify this object to refresh.

                      the user have to wait till the object

         the contents of the url is downloaded and during that
         time cvDnisMappingRefresh is set to refresh(2). When

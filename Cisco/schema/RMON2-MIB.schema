         by the user by creating protocol directory entries which are
         children of this protocol.
        
         An example of an entry that will often allow extensibility is
         `ip.udp'.  The probe may automatically populate some children
         of this node such as `ip.udp.snmp' and `ip.udp.dns'.
         A probe administrator or user may also populate additional
         children via remote SNMP requests that create entries in this
         table.  When a child node is added for a protocol for which the
         probe has no built in support, extending a parent node (for
         which the probe does have built in support),
         that child node is not extendible.  This is termed `limited
         extensibility'.
        
         When a child node is added through this extensibility
         mechanism, the values of protocolDirLocalIndex and
         protocolDirType shall be assigned by the agent.
        
         The other objects in the entry will be assigned by the
         manager who is creating the new entry.
        
         This object also describes whether or not this agent can
         recognize addresses for this protocol, should it be a network
         level protocol.  That is, while a probe may be able to
         recognize packets of a particular network layer protocol and
         count them, it takes additional logic to be able to recognize
         the addresses in this protocol and to populate network layer
         or application layer tables with the addresses in this
         protocol.  If this bit is set, the agent will recognize
         network layer addresses for this protoocl and populate the
         network and application layer host and matrix tables with
         these protocols.
        
         Note that when an entry is created, the agent will supply
         values for the bits that match the capabilities of the agent
         with respect to this protocol.  Note that since row creations
         usually exercise the limited extensibility feature, these
         bits will usually be set to zero."

                        to going 'commandedOutOfService'. In this state
                        the MG provides service but does not accept new
                        service requests (i.e. creation of connections)

            of the MG from 'inService' to 'commandedOutOfService' and

            'inService': Transition 'mgAdministrativeState' to
                       'inService'. In the course, the MG's
                       MGCs may get notified of this transition,
                       e.g. in the case of MGCP through emission
                       of RSIPs to registered call agents
                       according to policy.  
        
            'forcefulOutOfService': Take the gateway out-of-service 
                       forcefully. This releases any resources at 
                       the MG. In the course, the MGCs may get notified
                       of this transition, e.g. in the case of MGCP 
                       through emission of RSIPs to registered call agents
                       according to policy.
        
            'gracefulOutOfService': Take the gateway out-of-service 
                       gracefully. If there are no resources existing, 
                       'mgAdministrative' transitions to

                       'pendingOutOfService' thus initiating a graceful 
                       shutdown. In the course, the MGs MGCs may get
                       notified of this transition, e.g. in the case of 
                       MGCP through emission of RSIPs to registered call

## Group and Table Declarations

	table	cDot11CsMgrClientTable
	description "This table contains the list of 802.11 client
        stations currently managed by this device on the
        device interfaces.  This manager device may or
        may not be one of the WDS entities in the
        network. 
        
        This table is not applicable on any 802.11 
        wireless station that implements and supports the
        CISCO-CONTEXT-SERVICES-CLIENT-MIB. 
        
        Rows are created internally by the agent when 
        802.11 stations are attached to it."

        'infrastructure' mode if it discovers a WDS
        entity through advertisement messages and registers
        with it.

        its parent WDS entity, then the station operates in
        the 'distributed' mode.  However, the station

	description "This table contains the network element view of optical patches
        between two interfaces on the same network element.
        
        It is up to the user to keep the provisioned information that
        is reflected in this table in sync with the actual patches
        present between interfaces on the network element.
        Provisioning of a patch in this table does not cause a patch to
        be inserted; it only informs the network element that a patch
        has been, or is soon to be, added or removed.
        
        Each entry in the table models a unidirectional or
        bidirectional patch between two interfaces on the same
        network element. When one interface is patched to two
        different interfaces, one in the receive direction and
        the other in the transmit direction, the interface will
        appear in two different entries in the table.
        
        The terms low and high are chosen to represent numerical
        ordering of the two interfaces associated with a patch.  That
        is, the interface with the lower value of ifIndex is termed
        'low', while the other interface associated with the patch is

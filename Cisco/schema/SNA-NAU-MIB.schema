	table	snaNodeAdminTable
	description "This table contains objects which describe the
        configuration parameters for an SNA Node.  Link
        specific configuration objects are contained in
        a separate MIB module (e.g., SNA DLC MIB)
        
        
        
        
        
        corresponding to the link type.
        The table snaNodeAdminLinkTable contains objects
        which identify the relationship between node instances
        and link instances.
        
        The entries (i.e., rows) in this table can be created
        by either an Agent or a Management Station.
        The Management Station can do this through setting
        the appropriate value in the snaNodeAdminRowStatus.
        
        The snaNodeAdminRowStatus object describes the
        status of an entry and is used to change the status
        of an entry.  The entry is deleted by an Agent based
        on the value of the snaNodeAdminRowStatus.
        
        The snaNodeAdminState object describes the desired
        operational state of a Node and is used to change the
        operational state of a Node.  For example, such
        information may be obtained from a configuration file.
        
        How an Agent or a Management Station obtains the
        initial value of each object at creation time is an
        implementation specific issue.
        
        For each entry in this table, there is a corresponding
        entry in the snaNodeOperTable.
        While the objects in this table describe the desired
        or configured operational values of the SNA Node, the
        actual runtime values are contained in
        snaNodeOperTable."

	table	portChannelTable
	description "This table facilitates the creation and deletion of a
         Port Channel interface to achieve higher bandwidths
         than just one E_port. More than one E_port can be a 
         member of an Port Channel port.
         NOTE:Only E_ports can be members of an Port Channel
         port.
         
         A port is added to a Port Channel port by setting 
         portChannelMemberList,and the 'manner' in which the 
         agent performs the type of addition is determined 
         by the value of portChannelAddType.
         
         During the period when port(s) is being added to the
         Port Channel, the agent will not allow to change any 
         parameters of the port(s) being added. Also if the 
         operation is successful (i.e. port(s) is added to the 
         Port Channel) then also the agent will not allow to 
         change any parameters of the individual port(s) that is
         added. But any change done to the Port Channel port
         will also be applied to the port(s) which are member(s)
         of this Port channel port. Once a port(s) is removed
         from a Port Channel Port it will retain the values that
         it had when it was a member of the Port Channel port.
         It will not have the old values it had before joining
         the Port Channel port. 
        
         The port(s) that are added/removed to/from a 
         Port Channel port will be put into administratively
         down (ifAdminStatus='down') which results into
         operationally down(ifOperStatus='down'). To bring the 
         port up again, the user has to set the port to be
         administratively up(ifAdminStatus='up'). Then the port
         goes through its initialization cycle to become 
         active(ifOperStatus='up'). "

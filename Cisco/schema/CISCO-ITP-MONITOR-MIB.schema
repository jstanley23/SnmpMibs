         send a keepalive packet to the remote server at the 
         specified interval.  The monitor also expects to receive 
         a keepalive packet from the remote server at the same 
         interval.  If the monitor does not receive a 
         keepalive packet from the remote server in two times the 
         keep alive value, the monitor will close the TCP 
         session.  The value of zero disables the keep alive

         Normally, after the TCP session with the remote server 
         is established, the monitor will not send MSUs from the 
         monitored links to the server until the server responds 
         to the first keepalive.  
        
         This mechanism prevents the ITP from over-running the 
         server until the TCP session and receive window sizes
         are fully established.  
         
         Configuration of fast-start overrides this mechanism and 
         allows the ITP to start sending MSUs to the server 
         immediately after the TCP session is established.  
        
         Caution should be used with the fast-start configuration 
         as MSUs may be lost until the TCP session server and 
         receive window sizes are fully established. "

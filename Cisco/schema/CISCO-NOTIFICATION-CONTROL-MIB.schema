	table	cNotifCtrlTable
	description "This table represents the notifications to be controlled.
        To control a particular notification, user creates a row
        uniquely indexed by cNotifCtrlIndex using the
        cNotifCtrlRowStatus object.  The storage type of each row
        is indicated by  cNotifCtrlStorageType.
        
        The agent filters out the notification depending on the 
        current value of cNotifCtrlMode.  The agent also indicates 
        the current state of notification control through 
        cNotifCtrlCurrentState.
        
        This notification control mechanism is illustrated as follows.
        
        cNotifCtrlTable contains the list of notifications, that
        need to be controlled from the agent when 
        cNotifCtrlCurrentState is 'controlOn'.
        
        When cNotifCtrlMode is set to 'automaticControl', a timer is 
        started for the time interval represented by 
        cNotifCtrlSamplingInterval(eg: 10 mins) to monitor the number 
        of notifications being generated by the agent.  If the number
        of notifications generated exceeds the value represented by
        cNotifCtrlThreshold (eg: 100) before the timer expires, all
        notifications mentioned in cNotifCtrlTable are throttled.
        
        When the timer expires, it is restarted and the counter used
        to track the number of notifications generated is initialized to
        zero.  This controlling of notifications will continue until
        the number of notifications generated falls below the threshold
        in the given interval.
        
        When cNotifCtrlMode is set to 'forcedControl', all the
        notifications mentioned in cNotifCtrlTable are always
        throttled, irrespective of the values of
        threshold and sampling interval."

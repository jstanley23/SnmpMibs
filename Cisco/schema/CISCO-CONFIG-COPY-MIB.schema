	table	ccCopyErrorTable
	description "A table containing information about the failure
        cause of the config copy operation. An entry is
        created only when the value of ccCopyState changes
        to 'failed' for a config copy operation.
        
        Not all combinations of ccCopySourceFileType and
        ccCopyDestFileType need to be supported.  For
        example, an implementation may choose to support
        only the following combination:
        ccCopySourceFileType = 'runningConfig'
        ccCopyDestFileType = 'fabricStartupConfig'. 
        
        In the case where a fabric wide config copy 
        operation is being performed, for example by
        selecting ccCopyDestFileType value to be
        'fabricStartupConfig', it is possible that the
        fabric could have more than one device. In such
        cases this table would have one entry for each
        device in the fabric. In this case even if the 
        operation succeeded in one device and failed in 
        another, the operation as such has failed, so the
        global state  represented by ccCopyState 'failed',
        but for the device on which it was success, 
        ccCopyErrorDescription would have the 
        distinguished value, 'success'. 
        
        Once the config copy operation completes and if an
        entry gets instantiated, the management station 
        should retrieve the values of the status objects of 
        interest. Once an entry in ccCopyTable is deleted
        by management station, all the corresponding entries
        with the same ccCopyIndex in this table are also 
        deleted. 
        
        In order to prevent old entries from clogging the 
        table, entries age out at the same time as the 
        corresponding entry with same ccCopyIndex in 
        ccCopyTable ages out."

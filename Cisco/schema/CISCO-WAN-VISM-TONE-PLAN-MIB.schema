		readwrite enum tonePlanEntryStatusE	tonePlanEntryStatus
		description 	" This attribute specifies the status of this entry as to 
          whether this entry (row) contains usable Tone Plan  
          configuration information (object is set to 'configured'),  
          or if it is empty (object is set to 'unused'), or if is  
          temporarily (object is set to 'reloading') or  
          permanently (object is set to 'lostFile') unusable. 
        
        
          This tone plan information for this row can be used 
          by a DS-1 line only if this object has a value of 
          'configured (2)'. 
        
          To add a configured entry in the vismTonePlanTable 
          table, there must be an existing empty row with its  
          entry status set to 'unused(1)'. 
        
          Then before this empty row in the vismTonePlanTable 
          table can be changed to 'configured', it must, in 
          one single operation, be given all the usable 
          values necessary to be stored in the 
          tonePlanRegionName, tonePlanVersionNumber and  
          tonePlanFileName MIB objects for this row. In addition,  
          those values for the tonePlanRegionName and  
          tonePlanVersionNumber MIB objects pair must be 
          unique with respect to every other row of the 
          vismTonePlanTable. Then, as this existing empty row 
          is set with all three valid entries for the 
          tonePlanRegionName, tonePlanVersionNumber,  
          and tonePlanFileName MIB objects, the Entry Status 
          MIB object for this row will be finally, internally, 
          set to 'configured(2)'. This final 'configured' status 
          is the direct result of correctly setting these three 
          MIB objects with valid data. 
        
          In no case will an external manager be able to directly 
          set this MIB object to 'configured(2)' by a SNMP set 
          command, for such a single stand alone command will 
          be rejected. 
        
          Once a table entry is set to 'configured(2)' with 
          valid tonePlanRegionName, tonePlanVersionNumber, and 
          tonePlanFileName MIB objects for this row, then these 
          MIB objects may not be modified by any subsequent  
          SNMP set command.  In the case where a row needs to 
          have these objects changed, this entry must be cleared 
          from the table (paragraph below) and a new entry added 
          by the add process above. 
        
          Once an entry exists in the vismTonePlanTable table it 
          may be cleared and set to unused by setting this MIB 
          object to 'unused(1)'.  But before the entry status of 
          any entry in this table can be set to 'unused(1)', 
          there is a check to make sure there is no 
          vismDsx1TonePlanRegion MIB object and 
          vismDsx1TonePlanVersion MIB object pair in the 
          dsx1VismCnfGrpTable MIB table that may point to or 
          refer to this table entry (row) with its unique 
          tonePlanRegionName and tonePlanVersionNumber. 
        
          Once the entry status of an entry in this table is set 
          to 'unused(1)', all the other MIB objects for this 
          table row are set to defaults or to NULL. 
        
        
          Once an entry is 'configured', if a subsequent card 
          reset occurs the VISM card will attempt to restore 
          all of the configuration information by doing the 
          normal download of the latest MIB database, set all 
          'configured (2)' MIB objects to 'reloading (3)', and 
          then do an automatic background process to retrieve 
          all of the tone plan files from the server since they 
          were not downloaded by the PXM. If this retrieval of 
          the tone plan files succeeds then this MIB object 
          will be set back to 'configured (2)'. If this file 
          retrieval does not succeed, then this MIB object will 
          be set to 'lostFile (4)'. In no way will an external 
          manager be able to directly set this MIB object 
          to 'reloading (3)' or 'lostFile (4)' by a SNMP set 
          command. "

	table	cempMemBufferPoolTable
	description "Entries in this table define entities (buffer pools
        in this case) which are contained in an entity 
        (memory pool) defined by an entry from
        cempMemPoolTable.
        -- Basic Pool Architecture --
        1)Pools are classified as being either Static or 
          Dynamic. Static pools make no attempt to increase 
          the number of buffers contained within them if the 
          number of free buffers (cempMemBufferFree) are less
          than the number of minimum buffers (cempMemBufferMin).
          With Dynamic pools, the pool attempts to meet the 
          demands of its users.
        2)Buffers in a pool are classified as being either 
          Permanent or Temporary. Permanent buffers, as their
          name suggests, are always in the pool and are never
          destroyed unless the number of permanent buffers 
          (cempMemBufferPermanent) is changed. Temporary
          buffers are transient buffers that are created in
          dynamic pools whenever the free count 
          (cempMemBufferFree) of buffers in the pool drops 
          below the minimum (cempMemBufferMin).
        3)Buffers pools are classified as either Public or 
          Private. Public pools are available for all users 
          to allocate buffers from. Private pools are
          primarily used by interface drivers."

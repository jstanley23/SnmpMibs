	table	udpEndpointTable
	description "A table containing information about this entity's UDP
         endpoints on which a local application is currently
         accepting or sending datagrams.
        
         The address type in this table represents the address
         type used for the communication, irrespective of the
         higher-layer abstraction.  For example, an application
         using IPv6 'sockets' to communicate via IPv4 between
         ::ffff:10.0.0.1 and ::ffff:10.0.0.2 would use
         InetAddressType ipv4(1).
        
         Unlike the udpTable in RFC 2013, this table also allows
         the representation of an application that completely
         specifies both local and remote addresses and ports.  A
         listening application is represented in three possible
         ways:
        
         1) An application that is willing to accept both IPv4
            and IPv6 datagrams is represented by a
            udpEndpointLocalAddressType of unknown(0) and a
            udpEndpointLocalAddress of ''h (a zero-length
            octet-string).
        
         2) An application that is willing to accept only IPv4
            or only IPv6 datagrams is represented by a
            udpEndpointLocalAddressType of the appropriate
            address type and a udpEndpointLocalAddress of
            '0.0.0.0' or '::' respectively.
        
         3) An application that is listening for datagrams only
            for a specific IP address but from any remote
            system is represented by a
            udpEndpointLocalAddressType of the appropriate
            address type, with udpEndpointLocalAddress
            specifying the local address.
        
         In all cases where the remote is a wildcard, the
         udpEndpointRemoteAddressType is unknown(0), the
         udpEndpointRemoteAddress is ''h (a zero-length
         octet-string), and the udpEndpointRemotePort is 0.
        
         If the operating system is demultiplexing UDP packets
         by remote address and port, or if the application has
         'connected' the socket specifying a default remote
         address and port, the udpEndpointRemote* values should
         be used to reflect this."

         IPv4, IPv4z, IPv6, and IPv6z addresses are expected, or
         unknown(0) if datagrams for all local IP addresses are

         The value of this object can be represented in three
        
         possible ways, depending on the characteristics of the
         listening application:
        
         1. For an application that is willing to accept both
            IPv4 and IPv6 datagrams, the value of this object
            must be ''h (a zero-length octet-string), with
            the value of the corresponding instance of the
            udpEndpointLocalAddressType object being unknown(0).
        
         2. For an application that is willing to accept only IPv4
            or only IPv6 datagrams, the value of this object
            must be '0.0.0.0' or '::', respectively, while the
            corresponding instance of the
            udpEndpointLocalAddressType object represents the
            appropriate address type.
        
         3. For an application that is listening for data
            destined only to a specific IP address, the value
            of this object is the specific IP address for which
            this node is receiving packets, with the
            corresponding instance of the
            udpEndpointLocalAddressType object representing the
            appropriate address type.
        
         As this object is used in the index for the
         udpEndpointTable, implementors of this table should be
         careful not to create entries that would result in OIDs
         with more than 128 subidentifiers; else the information
         cannot be accessed using SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3."

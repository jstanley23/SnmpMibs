        dependency relationship with this table.

	table	ccvpSipTable
	description "The SIP service table lists each Customer Voice Portal SIP
        service configured on this server.  The CVP SIP service is a
        software module which always resides in the CVP Call Server.
        
        The CVP SIP service is a SIP Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA).
        On the front end, it supports two SIP call legs, one incoming
        and one outgoing.  This service does not terminate RTP flows;
        it only deals with SIP messages.  On the back end, the SIP
        service implements the (GED-125) Service Control Interface
        (SCI) to the Cisco Intelligent Contact Management (ICM)
        application for call control functions only (no VRU scripts).
        
        The purpose of a B2BUA is to act as an active intermediary
        for a call, communicating with both the source and the
        destination legs of the call, and providing 3rd party call
        control capabilities on behalf of a routing engine (such as
        the ICM contact router).  Because it must track the call
        throughout its life, it becomes a key source of call-level
        reporting data and a natural place for moderating call
        switching resources.
        
        Generally speaking, a SIP B2BUA is two User Agents (UAs).
        The device receives incoming calls in one UA and immediately
        creates an outgoing call via its other UA.  Thereafter, all
        SIP messages from either one are forwarded to the other.
        What makes it useful is the fact that it puts ICM in between
        the two legs.  On incoming calls, it asks the ICM where the
        outgoing call should be addressed.  Once the call has been
        delivered, ICM has the opportunity to end the outgoing leg
        and reconnect it to a subsequent destination.  In practice,
        there will typically be a delivery to the subsequent agents
        (call center agents - a human resources tasked with answering
        inbound calls and providing specific services) or back to
        the VRU leg.
        
        The SIP service table has a sparse dependent relationship
        with the (generic) ccvpService table.  The service index acts
        as the primary index, relating the entry to the corresponding
        entry in the ccvpService table.
        
        The SNMP agent constructs this table at startup.  Since
        services can only be added or deleted when the CVP
        application is stopped, service information entries cannot be
        added to or deleted from the table either by the agent or the
        management station while the application is running.  The
        agent will update service information table objects as their
        values change when the application is running.  All objects

        service to relay call arrival, departure and transfer

        The CVP H.323 service is a legacy service used only in H.323-
        based deployments.  Although this service started as a true,
        albeit incomplete, voice browser, its strength was its
        ability to effect complicated H.323 call control activities
        with the Gateway and the Cisco Call Manager.  Over time, the
        VXML Gateway's IOS voice browser supplanted it as a voice
        interaction device and call control became its main focus.
        
        SIP is still a young protocol compared to H.323 and there are
        still certain capabilities which either the gateway, the Call
        Manager or the protocol itself does not yet support.  Users
        who require these capabilities, as well as those who wish to

	table	ccvpIvrTable
	description "The IVR Service table lists each Customer Voice Portal
        Interactive Voice Response service configured on this server.
        Each entry in the table defines a separate IVR service; a
        single server is permitted to have multiple IVR services.
        The CVP IVR service is a software module which always resides
        int he CVP Call Server.
        
        The CVP IVR service is responsible for creating the VXML
        pages which implement the CVP Microapps based on 'Run Script'
        instructions received from the ICM. (The 'Run Script'
        instruction is part of the Service Control Interface offered
        with the GED-125 messaging protocol.)
        
        The service function as the VRU leg in ICM parlance and calls
        must be transferred to it from the SIP service in order to
        execute microapps.  The VXML pages created by this module are
        sent to the VXML Gateway to be executed.
        
        In legacy deployments only -- those which use H.323 instead
        of SIP -- the CVP IVR service can act as the switch leg as
        well.  The deployment includes a CVP H.3232 service which
        interacts with the CVP IVR service for call control
        activities.  Calls still need to be transferred to a VRU leg
        before microapps can be executed, however, in legacy
        deployments, that transferred leg may end up using the same
        CVP IVR service as the switch leg.
        
        The CVP IVR service plays a significant role in implementing
        CVP's native failover mechanism -- those capabilities which
        can be achieved without a Content Services Switch -- for
        Media Servers, ASR/TTS Servers and CVP VoiceXML Servers.  Up
        to two of each such server are supported and the CVP IVR
        service orchestrates retries and failover between them.
        
        This table has a sparse dependent relationship with the
        Service table.  The service index acts as the primary
        index, relating the entry to the corresponding entry in the
        Service table.
        
        The SNMP agent constructs this table at startup.  Since
        services can only be added or deleted when the CVP
        application is stopped, service information table entries
        cannot be added to or deleted from the table either by the
        agent or the management station while the application is

        The CVP reporting service receives reporting events from the
        CVP IVR service, the CVP SIP service, and the CVP VoiceXML
        service.  The service is deployed together with a database

        customers may develop custom reports based on it.
        
        There can only be one CVP Reporting Server in a deployment.
        This does not represent a single point of failure however,

	table	ccvpVxmlTable
	description "The Voice XML Service table lists each Customer Voice Portal
        Voice XML service installed and configured on this server.
        
        The CVP VXML server includes both the CVP VXML service and
        the VXML server software that executes complex IVR
        applications by exchanging VoiceXML pages with the VXML
        Gateway?s built-in voice browser.  Like almost all other CVP
        product components, it runs within a J2EE application server
        environment such as Tomcat, and many customers add their own
        custom-built or off-the-shelf J2EE components to interact
        with back-end hosts and services.  CVP VoiceXML Server
        applications are written using the CVP VoiceXML Studio, and
        deployed to the Server for execution.  They are invoked on an
        as-needed basis by a special microapp which must be executed
        from within the ICM routing script.
        
        The VXML Server may also be deployed in a standalone
        configuration ?- one which includes no ICM components.  In
        this model, applications are invoked as a direct result of
        calls arriving in the VXML Gateway, and a single
        post-application transfer is allowed.  Users may add the CVP
        VXML service software.  This affords standalone applications
        the additional ability to forward reporting events to a CVP
        Reporting Server, and to make ancillary routing requests and
        exchange call context information with an ICM if one is
        present.  However, the integration with ICM is nominal.
        
        This table has a sparse dependent relationship with the

                            system or service is unusable.  Immediate

                            occur soon; an error has occurred that

                            operational state information and may

                            soon to determine if action is needed.

                            diagnosing or resolving a problem but does

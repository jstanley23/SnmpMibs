        will be done.
        
        ciuImageURITable lists all the images for the
        supervisor cards as well as the line cards.
        
        If this object is set to 'true', all the images
        pointed to by the instances of ciuImageURI will be
        automatically copied to the standby supervisor.
        
        For example, assume that the ciuImageURITable looks
        like below -
        
         entPhysicalIndex ciuImageVariableName ciuImageURI
        
          25          'system'         bootflash://image.bin
          25          'kickstart'      slot0://boot.bin
          26          'ilce'           bootflash://linecard.bin
        
        So, if the ciuUpgradeMiscAutoCopy is 'true', then
        bootflash://image.bin from the active supervisor will
        be copied to the  bootflash://image.bin on the
        standby supervisor;  slot0://boot.bin will be copied
        to the slot0://boot.bin on the standby supervisor etc.
        
        If this object is set to 'false' then this copying
        of the images will not be done."

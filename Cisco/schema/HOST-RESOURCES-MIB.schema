	table	hrStorageTable
	description "The (conceptual) table of logical storage areas on 
        the host. 
        
        An entry shall be placed in the storage table for each 
        logical area of storage that is allocated and has 
        fixed resource limits.  The amount of storage 
        represented in an entity is the amount actually usable 
        by the requesting entity, and excludes loss due to 
        formatting or file system reference information. 
        
        These entries are associated with logical storage 
        areas, as might be seen by an application, rather than 
        physical storage entities which are typically seen by 
        an operating system.  Storage such as tapes and 
        floppies without file systems on them are typically 
        not allocated in chunks by the operating system to 
        requesting applications, and therefore shouldn't 
        appear in this table.  Examples of valid storage for 
        this table include disk partitions, file systems, ram 
        (for some architectures this is further segmented into 
        regular memory, extended memory, and so on), backing 
        store for virtual memory (`swap space'). 
        
        This table is intended to be a useful diagnostic for 
        `out of memory' and `out of buffers' types of 
        failures.  In addition, it can be a useful performance 
        monitoring tool for tracking memory, disk, or buffer

        The translation is applied in both ingress and egress

        makes the traffic arriving on the VLAN
        cvtGlobalOriginalVlan on the trunk ports to be mapped
        to or tagged with the VLAN cvtGlobalTranslatedVlan.
        It also causes all the traffic internally tagged with

        trunk ports to be tagged with VLAN
        cvtGlobalOriginalVlan.

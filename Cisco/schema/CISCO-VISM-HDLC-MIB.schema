## Group and Table Declarations

	table	vismHdlcChanTable
	description "This table is used for maintaining the statistics info 
        for the HDLC channels on VISM. It also keeps track of some 
        configurable parameters required for proper operation of 
        HDLC driver in VISM.  "

		readonly int	vismHdlcChanNum
		description 	"This object is the index of this table.  
         It refers to the ds0IfIndex in the dsx0VismCnfTable 
         (defined in CISCO-VISM-DSX0-MIB MIB). "

		readwrite enum vismHdlcRowStatusE	vismHdlcRowStatus
		description 	"This variable allows to add, delete or modify the entry. 
         'createAndGo': Use this to add an entry in this table. 
         There are two case of creating a entry: 
         1) a CCS (Common Channel Signaling) channel is 
         explicitly created for AAL2 Trunking. In this case, if 
         the DS0 already created for PRI(Primary Rate Interface) 
         or GR-303 the request of creation should be rejected. 
         2) A HDLC entry will be implicitly created before creating 
         a LAPD(D channel Data Link) entry. In this case if the 
         DS0 is already used for AAL2 trunking the request 
         should be rejected. No entry in LAPD shall be created.  
        
         'active': This values is returned, once the row is created 
         'destroy': Use this to delete an entry from this table.  
         According to the creation, an entry can be explicitly  
         destroyed or implicitly removed. "

         number with which the HDLC channel is associated 
         with. It is applicable only for trunking 
         applications where the CCS frames are transmitted 
         to the other end point over an AAL5 PVC. For 
        PRI or GR-303 applications, this is not applicable 
         since the CCS frames in that case are backhauled

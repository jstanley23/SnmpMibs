         SIP proxy/redirect server.
        
         The format of the address follows the IETF service location 
         protocol. The syntax is as follows:
        
            mapping-type:type-specific-syntax
        
         the mapping-type specifies a scheme for mapping the matching 
         dial string to a target server. The type-specific-syntax is 
         exactly that, something that the particular mapping scheme can
         understand.  For example,
            Session target           Meaning
            ipv4:171.68.13.55:1006   The session target is the IP

                                     with dns name pots.cisco.com.
        
         The valid Mapping type definitions for the peer follow:

         If 'false', the user agent's treatment of incoming

         That is, the user agent uses the Contact header(s)
         from the 3xx response to reinitiate another INVITE
         transaction to the user's new location.  The call 
         is redirected.

         redirected, instead it is released with the 
         appropriate PSTN cause code.
        
         The mapping of SIP 3xx response status codes to
         4xx response status codes is as follows:

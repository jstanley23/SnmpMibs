        The table includes counters that work together to
        integrate errors and the lack of errors on the TDM PW.
        An error is caused by a missing packet. Missing packet
        can be a result of, packet loss in the network,
        (uncorrectable) packet out of sequence, packet length error,
        jitter buffer overflow, and jitter buffer underflow.
        The result is declaring whether or not the TDM PW is in

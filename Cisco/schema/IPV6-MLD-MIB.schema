        Delay inserted into Group-Specific Queries sent in
        response to Leave Group messages, and is also the amount
        of time between Group-Specific Query messages.  This
        value may be tuned to modify the leave latency of the
        network.  A reduced value results in reduced time to
        detect the loss of the last member of a group."

        row, cause MLD Multicast Listener Reports to be sent on
        the internetwork-layer interface identified by this
        object.  Such a device would implement mldRouterMIBGroup
        only on its router interfaces (those interfaces with
        non-zero mldInterfaceProxyIfIndex).  Typically, the
        value of this object is 0, indicating that no proxying

		readonly timeticks	mldCacheExpiryTime
		description 	"The minimum amount of time remaining before this entry
        will be aged out.  A value of 0 indicates that the entry
        is only present because mldCacheSelf is true and that if
        the router left the group, this entry would be aged out
        immediately.  Note that some implementations may process
        Membership Reports from the local system in the same way
        as reports from other hosts, so a value of 0 is not

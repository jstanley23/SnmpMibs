         1. This object is not writable for physical interfaces.
         2. Temporary interface entries are only created by a SET
            of this object to createandWait(5).
         3. ifAdminStatus from the Interface MIB RFC 2863 is used
            to take a physical upstream channel offline, to be
            consistent with DOCSIS 1.x operation, as indicated in
            RFC 2670.
            In addition,

               reflected in this object as 'notInservice'.
         4. Temporary created rows MUST be set to 'active' with
            the purpose of validating upstream parameter
            consistency prior to transferring the parameters to the
            physical interface.
        
         Below is a mandatory procedure for adjusting the values
         of a physical interface:
         1. Create a temporary interface entry through an SNMP SET
            using 'createAndWait'.  At this point, the RowStatus
            reports 'notReady'.
            The Manager entity uses an ifIndex value outside the
            operational range of the physical interfaces for the
            creation of a temporary interface.
         2. Set the docsIfUpChannelCloneFrom object to the ifIndex
            value of the physical row to update.  Now
            docsIfUpChannelStatus reports 'notInService'.
         3. Change the upstream parameters to the desired values
            in the temporary row.
         4. Validate that all parameters are consistent by setting
            docsIfUpChannelStatus to 'active'.  A failure to set the
            RowStatus to 'active' returns the error 'commitFailed',
            which means the parameters are not compatible with the
            target physical interface.
         5. With docsIfUpChannelStatus 'active', transfer the
            parameters to the target physical interface by setting
            the object docsIfUpChannelUpdate to 'true'.
         6. Delete the temporary row by setting
            docsIfUpChannelStatus to 'destroy'."

		description 	"The calculated and truncated utilization index for this
         physical upstream or downstream channel, accurate as of
         the most recent docsIfCmtsChannelUtilizationInterval.
        
         Upstream Channel Utilization Index:
        
         The upstream channel utilization index is expressed as a
         percentage of mini-slots utilized on the physical channel,
         regardless of burst type.  For an Initial Maintenance
         region, the mini-slots for the complete region are
         considered utilized if the CMTS received an upstream
         burst within the region from any CM on the physical
         channel.  For contention REQ and REQ/DATA regions, the
         mini-slots for a transmission opportunity within the
         region are considered utilized if the CMTS received an
         upstream burst within the opportunity from any CM on the
         physical channel.  For all other regions, utilized
         mini-slots are those in which the CMTS granted
         bandwidth to any unicast SID on the physical channel.
        
         For an upstream interface that has multiple logical
         upstream channels enabled, the utilization index is a
         weighted sum of utilization indices for the logical
         channels.  The weight for each utilization index is the
         percentage of upstream mini-slots allocated for the
         corresponding logical channel.
         Example:
         If 75% of bandwidth is allocated to the first logical
         channel and 25% to the second, and the utilization
         indices for each are 60 and 40, respectively, the
         utilization index for the upstream physical channel is
         (60 * 0.75) + (40 * 0.25) = 55.  This figure
         applies to the most recent utilization interval.
        
         Downstream Channel Utilization Index:
        
         The downstream channel utilization index is a percentage
         expressing the ratio between bytes used to transmit data
         versus the total number of bytes transmitted in the raw
         bandwidth of the MPEG channel.  As with the upstream
         utilization index, the calculated value represents
         the most recent utilization interval.
         Formula:
         Downstream utilization index =
         (100 * (data bytes / raw bytes))
        
         Definitions:
         Data bytes:    Number of bytes transmitted as data in the

                        transmitting data, not including bytes
                        used for headers and other overhead.

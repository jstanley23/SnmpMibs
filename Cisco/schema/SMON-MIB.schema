## Group and Table Declarations

	table	dataSourceCapsTable
	description "This table describes RMON data sources and port copy
        capabilities. An NMS MAY use this table to discover the
        identity and attributes of the data sources on a given agent
        implementation. Similar to the probeCapabilities object,
        actual row-creation operations will succeed or fail based on
        the resources available and parameter values used in each
        row-creation operation.
        
        Upon restart of the RMON agent, the dataSourceTable, ifTable,
        and perhaps entPhysicalTable are initialized for the available
        dataSources.
        
        For each dataSourceCapsEntry representing a VLAN or
        entPhysicalEntry the agent MUST create an associated ifEntry
        with a ifType value of 'propVirtual(53)'. This ifEntry will be
        used as the actual value in RMON control table dataSource
        objects. The assigned ifIndex value is copied into the
        associated dataSourceCapsIfIndex object.
        
        It is understood that dataSources representing VLANs may not
        always be instantiated immediately upon restart, but rather as
        VLAN usage is detected by the agent. The agent SHOULD attempt
        to create dataSource and interface entries for all dataSources
        as soon as possible."

        - countErrFrames(0)
          The agent sets this bit for the dataSource if errored frames
          received on this dataSource can actually be monitored by the
          agent The agent clears this bit if any errored frames are
          not visible to the RMON data collector.
        
        - countAllGoodFrames(1)
          The agent sets this bit for the dataSource if all good
          frames received on this dataSource can actually be monitored
          by the agent. The agent clears this bit if any good frames
          are not visible for RMON collection, e.g., the dataSource is
          a non-promiscuous interface or an internal switch interface
          which may not receive frames which were switched in hardware
          or dropped by the bridge forwarding function.
        
        - countAnyRmonTables(2)
          The agent sets this bit if this dataSource can actually be
          used in any of the implemented RMON tables, resources
          notwithstanding. The agent clears this bit if this
          dataSourceCapsEntry is present simply to identify a
          dataSource that may only be used as portCopySource and/or a
          portCopyDest, but not the source of an actual RMON data
          collection.
        
        - babyGiantsCountAsGood(3)
          The agent sets this bit if it can distinguish, for counting
          purposes, between true giant frames and frames that exceed
          Ethernet maximum frame size 1518 due to VLAN tagging ('baby
          giants'). Specifically, this BIT means that frames up to
          1522 octets are counted as good.
        
          Agents not capable of detecting 'baby giants' will clear
          this bit and will view all frames less than or equal to 1518
          octets as 'good frames' and all frames larger than 1518
          octets as 'bad frames' for the purpose of counting in the
          smonVlanIdStats and smonPrioStats tables.
        
          Agents capable of detecting 'baby giants' SHALL consider
          them as 'good frames' for the purpose of counting in the
          smonVlanIdStats and smonPrioStats tables."

	table	portCopyTable
	description " Port Copy provides the ability to copy all frames from a
         specified source to specified destination within a switch.
         Source and destinations MUST be ifEntries, as defined by [22].
         One to one, one to many, many to one and many to many source to
         destination relationships may be configured.
        
         Applicable counters on the destination will increment for all
         packets transiting the port, be it by normal bridging/switching
         or due to packet copy.
         Note that this table manages no RMON data collection by itself,
         and an agent may possibly implement no RMON objects except
         objects related to the port copy operation defined by the
         portCopyCompliance conformance macro. That allows for a switch
         with no other embedded RMON capability to perform port copy
         operations to a destination port at which a different external
         RMON probe is connected.
        
         One to one, many to one and one to many source to destination
         relationships may be configured.
        
         Each row that exists in this table defines such a
         relationship. By disabling a row in this table the port copy
         relationship no longer exists.
        
         The number of entries and the types of port copies (1-1,
         many-1, 1-many) are implementation specific and could
         possibly be dynamic due to changing resource availability.
        
         In order to configure a source to destination portCopy
         relationship, both source and destination interfaces MUST be
         present as an ifEntry in the ifTable and their respective
         ifAdminStatus and ifOperStatus values MUST be equal to
         'up(1)'. If the value of any of those two objects changes
         after the portCopyEntry is activated, portCopyStatus will
         transition to 'notReady(3)'.
        
         The capability of an interface to be source or destination of
         a port copy operation is described by the 'copySourcePort(0)'
         and 'copyDestPort(1)' bits in dataSourceCopyCaps. Those bits
         SHOULD be appropriately set by the agent, in order to allow
         for a portCopyEntry to be created.
        
         Applicable counters on the destination will increment for all
         packets transmitted, be it by normal bridging/switching or
         due to packet copy."

		readwrite int	cncNcdpMaxDiameter
		description 	"The maximum possible height of a network clock distribution
        tree in the network.  (Alternatively this is known as the 
        maximum diameter of the network of devices that are 
        participating in NCDP.)  If all of the nodes in the network 
        are participating in the protocol then the maximum height of
        the network clock distribution tree is exactly the maximum
        diameter of the network.  If a proper subset of the nodes
        are participating in the NCDP then the maximum height of a
        network clock distribution tree is the maximum diameter of 
        the subnetwork induced by the removal of the 
        non-participating nodes and their associated links.
        
        The NCDP protocol entity uses the value of this object to
        determine when the NCDP algorithm has converged.  All 
        devices participating in NCDP within the bounds of the
        network must use the same value for maximum network diameter
        for the NCDP algorithm to operate properly. If the value of
        this object is set too small the resultant network may 
        exhibit unstable clocking characteristics and may constantly
        switch clock sources.  If the value is much larger than the
        network diameter, the algorithm will take longer to declare
        convergence than if the diameter were set closer to the 
        actual maximum network diameter, the result being that it 
        will take longer for the network to resynchronize after a 
        switchover to a secondary clock source located on a
        secondary device.

        generated.
        
        The message interval directly affects the convergence time 
        of the NCDP algorithm.  Convergence time is equal to the max 
        network diameter * message interval + transmission delays + 
        the time a configuration PDU is spent being processed in  
        each device.  Thus if transmission delays and processing 
        delays are  both close to 0, the convergence time is
        approximately ( max network diameter * message interval )
        milliseconds.
        
        The value of cncNcdpHoldTime should normally match the value 
        of this object.

        configuration PDUs out of an interface to a maximum of one
        configuration PDU per hold time interval per interface.
        
        The value of this object should normally be set        to match the 
        value of cncNcdpMessageInterval.  If the value of this 
        object is higher than the value of cncNcdpMessageInterval,
        NCDP configuration PDUs will end up being propagated at

        'none' indicates that the source of network clock 
        has not changed.
        
        'lossOfLock' indicates that the clock source was 
        changed because the network clocking hardware lost 
        lock on the previous network clock source.
        
        'lossOfActivity' indicates that the clock source was changed
        because the network clocking hardware detected a loss of 
        activity on the previous network clock source.
        
        'ncdpRestructure' indicates that the NCDP entity has changed 
        the clock source as a result of a network-wide network clock 
        distribution tree restructuring process.

	table	vismChanCacTable
	description "This table defines the CAC success or failure statistics.  
         CAC functionality is applied on a per PVC(Permanent virtual 
         circuit) basis for accepting the new calls in a switching 
         model (i.e when CRCX(CreateConnection) message is received 
         from the call agent) and when adding a new binding between a  
         CID(Channel Identifier) and a PVC in the AAL2 trunking  
         application ('addcid' command). In both switching and trunking 
         models, the CAC functionality is applied for upspeeding the 
         connections due to the detection of fax/modem tone on a  
         connection configured with voice compression. The entries in  
         this table are implicitly created and deleted with the  
         creation and deletion of entries in vismChanCnfGrpEntry

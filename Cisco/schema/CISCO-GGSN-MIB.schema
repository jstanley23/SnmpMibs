        to route IP packets beyond MS. This works only if a static

        On enabling this feature, GGSN will route the packets in
        both process switch path and cef switch path. This is 
        supported only for IP PDP type.
        
        This feature has some limitations:
        - This is not scalable, since the operator has to add static
          route to all the node beyond the MS.
        - Only works for MS having static address.
        - In case of GTPv1 the MS has to select TFT's so as to allow
          traffic flow in the downlink direction.
        - IP address assignment/Radius for the devices behind the MS 
          needs to be done within the scope of that network; the GGSN 
          will not provide this facility in anyway for the hosts 
          behind the MS. 
        - In case for MWAM and Cat6500/7600 environment, the static

## Group and Table Declarations

	table	cDot11RadioDiagTable
	description "This table allows a network management system to
        control the behavior of the radio interface on an
        802.11 station and the 802.11 clients associated with
        that station through that particular interface for
        the purpose of radio environment diagnosis.  The
        administrator can modify the MIB objects in this
        table to temporarily alter the behavior of that
        particular dot11 radio interface and the respective
        associated clients.
        
        This table has a sparse dependent relationship
        with ifTable defined in IF-MIB.  There exists a
        row in this table corresponding to the row for each
        dot11 interface found in ifTable.  However, this
        table is not applicable for virtual dot11
        interfaces. "

        The value this object takes depends on the value of
        the object dot11PHYType defined in
        IEEE802dot11-MIB.
        
        The semantics are as follows.
        
        If dot11PHYType equals 'ofdm', the acceptable values
        for this object are 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48,

        If dot11PHYType equals 'dsss' or 'erp', the
        acceptable values for this object are from 1 to 14.
        
        The channel numbers that can be assigned to this
        object from the set of acceptable values mentioned
        above vary depending on the value of the MIB object
        cd11IfCurrentCarrierSet defined in CISCO-DOT11-IF
        MIB.
        
        The object cDot11RadioDiagSettingsEnabled must be set
        to 'true' to apply the temporary value specified
        through this object to the 802.11 interface.
        Setting cDot11RadioDiagSettingsEnabled to 'false'
        temporary value to that interface  restores
        the channel setting of this interface to the original
        value that was there before applying the temporary
        value to that interface. A value of 0 indicates that
        this object hasn't been configured with a valid

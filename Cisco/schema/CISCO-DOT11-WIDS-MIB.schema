	table	cDot11WidsEapolFloodTable
	description "This table gives the statistics on the EAPOL flood
        attacks observed at this radio interface.
        
        An entry in this table is created by the agent when
        this 802.11 station detects an EAPOL flood attack.
        All the columns in the entries except the
        cDot11WidsEapolFloodStopTime are populated when
        the attack is observed first.  The object
        cDot11WidsEapolFloodStopTime is populated when no
        flood conditions are observed following the initial
        observation at the time indicated by
        cDot11WidsEapolFloodStartTime.
        
        This can be illustrated by the following example.
        
        Assume that the monitoring interval is configured 
        to 1 minute through the
        cDot11WidsEapolFloodInterval object and the number
        of attempts is set to 5.
        
        At the end of the first minute after this
        configuration is made,  client c1 is found to
        have made 4 attempts and another client c2 have
        made 3.  Hence, in total, the attempt count
        exceeds 7 and the agent adds a new row to this
        table.  The cDot11WidsFloodStopTime carries a
        value of 0 at this point in the newly added row.
        The MIB object cDot11WidsEapolFloodClientMac
        at this point holds the MAC address of c1
        and cDot11WidsEapolFloodClientCount holds the
        value of 4.
        
        At the end of the second interval,  assume that
        the clients are found to have made only 4
        attempts in total with c1 and c2 making 3 and 1
        attempt(s) respectively.  Now the total count
        is not found to exceed the threshold.  Hence
        the flood is observed to be stopped.  The
        object cDot11WidsEapolFloodStopTime is now
        populated with this time at which the flood is
        observed to be stopped.  The MIB object
        cDot11WidsEapolFloodClientMac at this point
        holds c1's MAC address and 
        cDot11WidsEapolFloodClientCount would hold a
        value of 7. If the count is found to exceed in
        the next interval, it will be treated as a
        beginning of a new flood event and hence a new
        entry will be created for the same.
        
        Assume the case where, at the end of the second
        interval, the total count continues at the
        rate above the threshold, with c1 making 5 and
        c2 making 2 attempts respectively.  Since the
        flood is not observed to be stopped,  the
        object cDot11WidsFloodStopTime continues to
        hold a value of zero.
        
        The agent at anytime will retain only the most
        recent and maximum number of entries, as given
        by cDot11WidsFloodMaxEntriesPerIntf,  for a
        particular value of ifIndex.  The older entries
        are purged automatically when the number of
        entries for a particular ifIndex reaches its
        maximum.
        
        This table has a expansion dependent relationship
        with ifTable defined in IF-MIB.  There exists a
        row in this table corresponding to the row for each
        interface of iftype ieee80211(71) found in ifTable.
        cDot11WidsEapolFloodIndex acts as the
        expansion index. "

        At the end of each interval time indicated by

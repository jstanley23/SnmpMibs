	table	cccaInstanceTable
	description "The instance table is a list of enterprise contact center
        application instances.  Each instance represents a contact
        center application solution.  A solution includes a collection
        of interconnected functional components (e.g. a router, a
        logger and a peripheral gateway), each of which perform a
        specific, necessary function of the contact center
        application.
        
        A single server is permitted to have multiple functional
        components of a different type, but also multiple components
        of the same type, each of which may be part of a different
        instance.  A perfect example of the latter is in a telephony
        service provider environment where a single server could have
        ten router components, each assigned to a different 'customer'
        instance.  All ten are concurrently functional but route
        contacts only within the context of the instance that they are
        assigned.  In this scenario, the instance table would have ten
        entries.
        
        The instance table is not directly dependent upon any other
        table, however, the other functional component tables are
        dependent upon the instance table.  The instance table index
        serves as a primary index for all other functional component
        tables in order to properly relate the functional components
        to the appropriate instance.
        
        The SNMP agent constructs the instance table at startup.
        Since instances can only be configured while the enterprise
        contact center application is stopped, instance table entries
        cannot be added to or deleted from the table nor can object
        values be modified either by the agent or the management

	table	cccaComponentElmtTable
	description "The component element table provides a list of component
        (operating system) services or processes that are elements of
        an enterprise contact center application functional component.
        Each entry identifies a single process that is a necessary
        element of the functional component.
        
        This table also provides a one-to-one mapping of entries to a
        corresponding entry in IETF standard host and application MIB
        tables.  The HOST-RESOURCES and SYSAPPL MIBs expose tables
        that provide additional instrumentation for software and
        applications and for the processes that make up that software
        or those applications.  The HOST-RESOURCES-MIB entries in
        'hrSWRunTable' and 'hrSWRunPerfTable' and the SYSAPPL-MIB
        entries in 'sysApplElmtRunTable' have a one-to-one
        relationship to entries in the component element table.  The
        entries in these standard MIB tables are solely or partially
        indexed by the operating system process identifier (ID).  The
        process ID is an integer value that uniquely identifies a
        single process that is currently running on the host.  Entries
        in the component element table maintain its process ID; this
        value is used to relate the entry to a corresponding entry in
        the referenced tables of HOST-RESOURCES-MIB and SYSAPPL-MIB.
        
        Entries in these tables of the HOST-RESOURCES and SYSAPPL MIBs
        expose similar information about each process; in some cases,
        objects are duplicated.  However, while the HOST-RESOURCES-MIB
        lists processes with no further relationship, the SYSAPPL-MIB
        relates these same processes to installed software packages
        and the elements that make up those packages.
        
        Entries in the component element table cannot be similarly
        indexed as the referenced standard MIB tables because, should
        the process terminate (expectedly or unexpectedly), the entry
        would need to be removed from the table since its index or
        process ID is thus unknown.  This behavior diminishes the
        agent's ability to express a component element's current
        status since the entry no longer exists.  However, to relate
        this table to the referenced standard MIB tables, entries in
        the component element table maintain the current process ID
        of the element.  This provides the one-to-one relationship
        that allows the management station to drill down further on
        each functional component and present instrumentation related
        to each element of that component from these standard MIB
        tables.
        
        This table has a expansion relationship with the component
        table; there will be one or many entries in this table that
        relate to a single entry in the component table.
        
        Because the set of elements of a contact center functional
        component are finite and static, this table is constructed by
        the SNMP agent at startup; entries cannot be added or deleted
        at run time.  The object values of each element entry may
        change periodically if the run state of the process changes.
        The SNMP agent will alter the RunID and Status object values
        to reflect the correct process ID and run status of that
        process.  All objects in this table are read-only to the
        management station."

		notaccessible enum cccaEventStateE	cccaEventState
		description 	"The event state object identifies the state (not to be
        confused with severity) of the notification and potentially
        the current state of the functional component that generated
        the notification.  The possible states are:
        
        'clear':            The clear state indicates that the
                            condition which generated a previous raise
                            notification has been resolved.
        
        'applicationError': The application error state alerts the
                            recipient that an error exists in the
                            enterprise contact center application but
                            that the error does not affect the
                            operational status of the functional
                            component.
        
        'raise':            A raise state identifies a notification
                            received as a result of a health-impacting
                            condition, such as a process failure.  A
                            subsequent clear state notification will
                            follow when the error condition is
                            resolved.
        
        'singleStateRaise': The single state raise state indicates
                            that a health-impacting error has occurred
                            and that a subsequent clear state
                            notification will not be forthcoming.  An
                            example of a single state raise condition
                            is an application configuration error that
                            requires the system to be stopped and the
                            problem resolved by an administrator
                            before the affected component will

	table	dlswCircuitTable
	description "This table is the circuit representation in the DLSw
         entity. Virtual data links are used to represent any internal
         end stations.  There is a conceptual row associated with
         each data link.  Thus, for circuits without an intervening
         transport connection, there are two conceptual rows
         for each circuit.
        
         The table consists of the circuits being established,
         established, and as an implementation option, circuits that
         have been disconnected.  For circuits carried over
         transport connections, an entry is created after
         the CUR_cs was sent or received.  For circuits between
         two locally attached devices, or internal virtual MAC
         addresses, an entry is created when the equivalent of
         CUR_cs sent/received status is reached.
        
         End station 1 (S1) and End station 2 (S2) are used to
         represent the two end stations of the circuit.
         S1 is always an end station which is locally attached.
         S2 may be locally attached or remote.  If it is locally
         attached, the circuit will be represented by two rows indexed
         by (A, B) and (B, A) where A & B are the relevant MACs/SAPs.
        
         The table may be used to store the causes of disconnection of
         circuits.  It is recommended that the oldest disconnected
         circuit entry be removed from this table when the memory
         space of disconnected circuits is needed."

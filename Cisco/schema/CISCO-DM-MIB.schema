        If dmConfigDomainIdType is 'preferred', then domain ID
        configured is called 'preferred Domain ID'. The valid
        values are between 0 and 239. In a situation where 
        this domain could not be assigned, any other domain ID
        would be acceptable. The value '0' means any domain ID.
        
        If dmConfigDomainIdType is 'static', then domain ID is
        called 'static Domain ID' and valid values are between

	description "This table contains interface configuration of the
        domain manager per VSAN.
        
        An entry in this table is automatically created when 
        an E_port becomes non-isolated and there is a
        entry in dmTable for that VSAN. 
        
        An entry is deleted automatically from this table if :
        a) the correponding interface becomes non-existent, or
        b) the correponding interface becomes a non-E_port
           and all the writable objects has default values.
                          or
        c) the dmTable entry for the corresponding VSAN is
           deleted.
        
        Entries in this table can be created via dmIfRowStatus 
        only as the means to specify non-default parameter values
        for an interface at a time when that interface is either 
        down or is a non-E_port.
        
        So an entry in this table exists when one or both of 
        these conditions holds:
        - one or more configuration parameters have non-default
          values for an interface which is either down or a 
          non-E_port and corresponding VSAN has an entry in the 
          dmTable, and/or
        - the interface is an E_port and it is up.
        
        This has a number of consequences:
        - an entry exists for a non-E_port or an E_port which is
          down whenever that interface has non-default parameters
          and the corresponding VSAN has an entry in the dmTable;
        - an entry cannot be created (via dmIfRowStatus) for an
          interface with default parameters; instead, the agent
          creates/deletes an entry for an interface with default
          parameters according to whether the E_port is up or
          down.
        - an entry can not be created via dmIfRowStatus unless
          non-default parameter values are (simultaneously) 
          configured for an interface which is a non-E_port or a 
          down interface, and the correspoding VSAN has an entry
          in the dmTable.
        - deleting an entry via RowStatus when either the 
          interface is down and configured with non-default 
          values or the interface is up, is equivalent to 
          resetting its parameters to their default values.
          If the interface is down and was configured with

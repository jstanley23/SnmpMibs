## Group and Table Declarations

	table	cLIdsIpsSensorConfigTable
	description "This table facilitates the configuration of a group
        of IPS sensors to which the LWAPP controller would
        subscribe to retrieve the IDS events from the
        respective sensors.
        
        IPS sensors are used to protect the network by helping
        to detect and report threats like worms, viruses etc.
        By subscribing to such a sensor, the LWAPP controller,
        through appropriate interfaces, can retrieve the
        events detected by the sensor and report the same
        to the NMS.  The controller can accept the request, to
        block the packets from an IP address, from each Sensor
        configured through this table and block the data
        traffic originating from that particular source. 
        
        Rows are added or deleted to the table by explicit 
        management actions initiated by the user from a
        network management station.  Information about each
        IPS sensor is uniquely identified by the network
        address of the respective sensor. "

	table	cLIdsClientExclTable
	description "This table lists those clients whose data packets
        are to be blocked as requested by the IPS sensor
        due to the detection of attacks at layer 3 to
        layer 7 involving the particular client.
        
        This table has an expansion dependent relationship
        with cLIdsIpsSensorConfigTable.  There may exist one
        or more rows corresponding to the row for each
        sensor configured through cLIdsIpsSensorConfigTable. 
        
        An entry is added to this row by the agent when the
        controller receives the block request from one of
        the IPS sensors configured through
        cLIdsIpsSensorConfigTable.  The controller sends
        the ciscoLwappIdsShunClientUpdate notification
        to indicate that the controller shall be blocking
        the particular client for a period equal to
        cLIdsClientTimeRemaining.
        
        The entry corresponding to a particular client is
        removed when one of the following happens.
        
        (i) When the configuration about the particular
        IPS sensor is removed from the controller, either
        through an explicit management action initiated
        through the NMS or when the controller reboots.
        
        (ii) When the remaining time period for which the
        client will be blocked as indicated by 
        cLIdsClientTimeRemaining, expires.
        
        (iii) When the IPS sensor explicitly requests the
        controller to stop blocking the client's data
        packets.
        
        The controller sends the ciscoLwappIdsShunClientUpdate
        notification with cLIdsClientTimeRemaining equal to
        0 to indicate that the client won't be blocked any
        further, on one of the three conditions for entry
        removal mentioned above. "

		description 	"An indication of whether the CMTS CM Poller is running. 
        
        When the poller is enabled, it polls the remote CMs  
        periodically specified in the cdrqCmtsCmPollerInterval 
        mib object. 
        
        cdrqCmtsCmPollerInterval and cdrqCmtsCmPollerCommunity 
        need to have valid values in order to be able to set 
        cdrqCmtsCmPollerEnable to TRUE. 
        
        The operation can be expensive depending on how many CMs  
        that the poller would be polling.  It is suggested to  
        have it disabled when not needed."

		readwrite int	cdrqCmtsCmPollerInterval
		description 	"An interval between two polling cycles of the CMTS CM  
        Poller.  
        
        The poller will not start the next cycle until it  
        finished polling for the last CM , even though the  
        time has expired.  If the cdrqCmtsCmPollerInterval is  
        too small with a large number of CMs, the poller would 
        tie up the CPU and resources and possibly degrade the 
        system's performance. 
        
        Any change in the cdrqCmtsCmPollerInterval will not 
        be reflected if the poller has already been enabled. 
        
        User cannot set cdrqCmtsCmPollerInterval to 0 but 
        will read 0 when CMTS is first restarted and remote-query 
        is not configured. Once poller is configured, 
        cdrqCmtsCmPollerInterval will retain the value even if 
        poller is later disabled"

	description "This table contains the status of the cable modems that  
        are polled by the CMTS CM Poller. The information will be

        The removal of CM from the list or adding a new CM to the  
        list won't be reflected until the next polling cycle. 
        
        Depending on how many CMs that the poller is polling,  
        polling this table constantly can be quite expensive;  
        Therefore, it is best to poll upon receipt of the  
        cdrqCmtsCmRQDoneNotification. As a hedge against lost  
        notifications, periodic background polling should  
        be performed.  Howerver, excessive polling could  
        degrade performance."

        itself, it indicates that the status has already been

        to happen, the NMS can increase the cdrqCmtsCmPollInterval  
        so that the cdrqCmtsCmPollTime

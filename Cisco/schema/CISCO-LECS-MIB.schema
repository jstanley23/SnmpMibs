                      will supersede operation of the ELAN in the presence
                      of a lower priority LES.
                        Note that the LECS will adjust the number entered to
                      fit into a contiguous numbering space equalling the
                      number of LESs defined for the particular ELAN.  For
                      example if there is one LES defined for an ELAN then
                      that LES's priority will always be zero since there
                      are no other LESs to contend with.  Setting that LESs
                      priority to ten (e.g.) will work but the net result
                      will be that the priority will still be zero (as will
                      be verified by consequent retrieval of this objects
                      value).  If a second LES is defined for this ELAN with
                      a priority of ten (e.g.) the net result would be that
                      the second LES will have a priority of one since it is
                      the only other LES for that ELAN and behind in
                      priority from the first LES.  If the second LES were
                      given a priority of zero at any time then it would
                      keep the priority of zero and the first LES would
                      transition to having a priority of one.
                        Note that defining a new LES with a priority already
                      in existance by another LES has the effect of giving
                      the new LES the designated priority and reducing the
                      priority (numerically increasing) of all LESs equal to
                      and below it in rank.
                        Likewise, deleting a LES from this table will cause
                      LESs below it in priority (numerically greater) to
                      move up in the table (modifying their priority value
                      to be one less) to fill in the now empty slot.  
                        In this way a table, with at least one entry, should
                      always contain entries with priorities including zero
                      up to the number of entries minus one (0..(n-1))."

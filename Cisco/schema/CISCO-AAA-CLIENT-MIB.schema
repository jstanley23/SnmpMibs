## Group and Table Declarations

	table	cacPriorityTable
	description "This table contains entries for AAA authentication 
         methods configured in the system. At startup, agent 
         set up all the entries of the table. All authentication
         methods will be disabled except local authentication will 
         be enabled for each session type and login mode. Users 
         later can enable/disable a specific authentication method 
         through cacEnable object. 
        
         The following table describes the startup state of each
         authentication method and session type in normal login
         mode and enable login mode.

## Group and Table Declarations

        attenuation on VOAs."

	(
		notaccessible enum cVoaDirectionE	cVoaDirection
		description 	"This is the second index into the cVoaTable and indicates
        the direction for which the attenuation level at this
        interface is being controlled, in this entry."
		characteristics "-N cVoaDirection -O 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.262.1.1.1.1.1 -T INTEGER -A NA -X equal -F 0"

		readwrite enum cVoaAttenuationControlModeE	cVoaAttenuationControlMode
		description 	"This object is used to set the mode of controlling the
        attenuation level of a VOA at an interface.
        
        When the mode is set to 'manual', the attenuation level is
        configured manually, by setting the desired attenuation
        level in the cVoaAttenuation object. The cVoaDesiredPower
        object does not apply in this case.
        
        When the mode is set to 'automatic', the attenuation level
        is continuously adjusted to maintain a desired power level,
        after attenuation. The desired optical power level after
        attenuation is configured using the cVoaDesiredPower object.
        The cVoaAttenuation object cannot be configured in this case,
        but it indicates the attenuation level derived from the
        desired power level.
        
        The automatic mode of controlling attenuation should not be
        used when the monitored power level includes multiple
        wavelengths, since the power level monitor cannot distinguish
        between a decrease in power across all wavelengths, versus a
        loss of power of some but not all wavelengths. If some but not
        all wavelengths go down, this would cause the attenuation level
        to be automatically decreased, leading to an increase in the
        power level of the remaining wavelengths."

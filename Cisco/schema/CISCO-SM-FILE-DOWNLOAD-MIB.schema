## Group and Table Declarations

	description "A table of files that have been downloaded on some non-
        volatile storage (For example: Hard Disk, Flash Disk etc)
        on the controller card by mechanisms such as ftp, tftp etc 
        and available for transfer to applicable service modules."

		description 	"The name of the file that has been downloaded on some 
         non-volatile storage on the controller card.

        to the file name."

		description 	" An integer that specifies the slot number of  the
                 service module to which the file needs to be downloaded.
                 
          A value of 100 would indicate that file needs to be 
          downloaded to all applicable service modules."

		readonly enum csDefineFileStatusE	csDefineFileStatus
		description 	"The overall status of the file validation and service module
         download as surmised by the controller card. A more detailed 
         status on service module downloads could be obtained in 
         csFileStatusTable which stores download information specific 
         to a particular slot. 
        
        inProgress - processing file validation/download request
        success - file has been validated and downloaded to all 
                  applicable service modules (as per value in 
                  csDefineSlotNumber) successfully.   
        noMemory - failure due to insufficient dynamic memory
        fileOpenFailed - failure to open the file downloaded to some 
                         non-volatile storage on the controller card. 
        fileReadFailed - failure to read the file downloaded to some 
           non-volatile storage on the controller card.
        fileNotValid - file parsing/validation failed
        downloadFailed - download to service module failed
        aborted - download aborted due to switchover in a
           redundant controller card configuration
        dbUpdateFailed - error in accessing/updating the database
        miscError - miscellaneous error due to lack of internal
                           resource (eg. error obtaining semaphore etc)
        
        This object is valid only after the entry status becomes 'active'.
        
        This object is especially useful when csDefineSlotNumber has a
        value of 100 signifying a download to all applicable service 
        modules. This object gives overall status of the download request 
        and hence, has a value of 'downloadFailed' even if one SM fails 
        the download. csFileStatusTable could be consulted for the purpose
        of obtaining a list of SMs that failed the download and their 
        corresponding reasons."

		readwrite enum csDefineFileOperationE	csDefineFileOperation
		description 	" An integer that defines the file operation: 
        sendToSMsOnly - send file contents saved in database to all 
          applicable service modules.
        updateAndSend - validate file, save contents into database
           and send to all applicable service modules.
        
        The database here refers to either a disk or a RAM database that
        is saved during controller card switchovers. The file contents 
        are saved prior to service module download. In case of failure 
        to download to SMs,the operation could be re-initiated with 
        csDefineFileOperation having value sendToSMsOnly. This would 
        avoid unnecessary download of the same file to controller card 
        storage and file parsing/validation. "

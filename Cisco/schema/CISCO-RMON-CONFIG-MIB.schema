		description 	"This object controls the way the SNMP agent implements the
        getnext operation for tables with a TimeFilter index, such
        as those found in the RMON2-MIB module.
        
        If this object has the value `stopAfterOne(1)', then a GetNext
        or GetBulk operation will provide one pass through a given 
        table, i.e., the agent will continue to the next object or 
        table, instead of incrementing a TimeMark INDEX value, even if
        there exists higher TimeMark values which are valid for
        the same conceptual row.
        
        This mode is not strictly compliant with the TimeFilter textual
        convention definition, because potentially many conceptual rows
        will be skipped instead of returned in a GetNext or GetBulk
        operation.  Such rows are identical to each other, except for
        the returned TimeMark INDEX value. This mode is intended only
        for testing purposes, however it may also be useful if an NMS
        wishes to utilize the GetBulk PDU. This mode will prevent the
        GetBulk responses from containing duplicate rows due to the
        TimeFilter mechanism.
        
        If this object has the value `stopAfterAll(2)', then a getNext
        or getBulk MIB walk will repeat through the same MIB table 
        until the TimeMark for the most-recently changed entry is 
        reached. Note that as long as traffic occurs on the monitored 
        interface, it is possible a highest value of the TimeFilter 
        INDEX may never be reached. This mode is strictly compliant 
        with the TimeFilter textual convention definition.  Note that 
        GetBulk PDU responses in this mode will likely contain multiple
        copies of the same MIB instances, differing only in the 
        TimeMark INDEX value.
        
        As an example, consider row 'fooEntry' which was last updated
        at 'time 1000'. An NMS may use any TimeMark INDEX value in the
        range '0' to '1000', and the current (i.e., time of get 
        request) counter values for the 'fooEntry' will be returned by
        agent. In the 'stopAfterOne' mode, the agent will not increment
        the fooEntry TimeMark index under any conditions. In the
        'stopAfterAll' mode, the agent will increment any fooEntry
        TimeMark INDEX value in the range '0' to '999', up until
        the TimeMark value of '1000' is reached."

		description 	"This object along with the ifIndex of a particular interface
        uniquely identifies an HSRP group.
        
        Group numbers 0,1 and 2 are the only valid group numbers
        for TokenRing interfaces. For other media types, numbers
        range from 0 to 255. Each interface has its own set of group
        numbers. There's no relationship between the groups
        configured on different interfaces. Using a group number
        on one interface doesn't preclude using the same group
        number on a different interface. For example, there can be
        a group 1 on an Ethernet and a group 1 on Token Ring. More
        details can be found from RFC 2281."

		description 	"This is an unencrypted authentication string which is

        mismatch prevents a router interface from learning the
        designated IP address or HSRP timer values from
        other HSRP-enabled routers with the same group number.
        
        The function of this object is not to supply any sort of
        security-like authentication but rather to confirm that
        what's happening is what's intended. In other words, this
        is meant for sanity checking only."

		readwrite gauge	cHsrpGrpPriority
		description 	"The cHsrpGrpPriority helps to select the active and the
        standby routers. The router with the highest priority is
        selected as the active router. In the priority range of 0
        to 255, 0 is the lowest priority and 255 is the highest
        priority.
        
        If two (or more) routers in a group have the same priority,
        the one with the highest ip address of the interface is the
        active router. When the active router fails to send a Hello
        message within a configurable period of time, the standby
        router with the highest priority becomes the active
        router.
        
        A router with highest priority will only attempt to
        overthrow a lower priority active router if it is
        configured to preempt.  But, if there is more than one
        router which is not active, the highest priority non-active
        router becomes the standby router."

		description 	"This delay is the time difference between a router power
        up and the time it can actually start preempting the
        currently active router.
        
        When a router first comes up, it doesn't have a complete
        routing table. If it's configured to preempt, then it will
        become the Active router, but it will not be able to
        provide adequate routing services. The solution to this is
        to allow for a configurable delay before the router
        actually preempts the currently active router."

		description 	"HSRP routers learn a group's Hellotime or Holdtime from

        generating hello messages when this router becomes the

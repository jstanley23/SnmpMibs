		description 	"This object indicates the operational state of the bridge

        instances and multiple service instances can be attached to a  
        single physical interface defining various kinds of services.
        Bridge domain members have many to one relationship with
        interface

        the state of cbdMemberOperState should be down. When
        ifOperStatus

        either up or down based on the state of underlying service
        instance.

        'up': the bridge domain member is fully operational and

        physical interface and the underlying service instance
        are administratively up.

	table	cpAtmIfConfigTable
	description "This table is used to configure propAtm interfaces.
         Each entry in this table has a corresponding ifTable
         entry with ifType propAtm(197).  The ifIndex value
         of that associated ifTable entry is used to index
         this this table.
         The entry of this table is added after its associated  
         ifEntry is added in the ifTable of IF-MIB.
         It is impossible to add/delete entry to/from this table."

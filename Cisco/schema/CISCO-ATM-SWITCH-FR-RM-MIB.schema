         Interworking Function connections, on the Frame Relay Port
         Adapter Module.
        
         These objects become available as each Frame Relay
         and FUNI interface is defined on the device. The
         corresponding ifTypes are frameRelayService(44)
         and atmFuni(106) respectively.
        
         An unique set of threshold parameters are available for
         every supported Interworking Function service
         category, and would be applied to all connections
         belonging to that particular service category, on that
         Frame Relay or FUNI interface."

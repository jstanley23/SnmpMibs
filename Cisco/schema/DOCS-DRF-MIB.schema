        channels gets a frequency of f -1*bandwidth.
        
        'adjacentChannel' 'adjacentChannelOrder' BITs may be set to

        A PHY parameter dependency group means that a set to 
        a QAM channel parameter may affect the value of 
        other QAM Channels in the group.
        
        TSID is a broadcast term borrowed by the M-CMTS 
        architecture to represent a unique identifier of QAM
        channels in the M-CMTS architecture. 
        
        TSID Group is the DEPI concept of a set of QAM channels
        with a PHY parameter dependency. This module refers to 
        TSID group as a PHY dependency Group.
        
        This table uses the ENTITY-MIB physical component structure
        to allows the managed system to describe the QAM channels'
        PHY parameters dependencies. A management entity can use
        the information from this table to generate the DEPI TSID
        Groups.
        
        Examples of PHY dependencies could be usage of adjacent
        frequencies, or QAM channels of RF ports restricted, or 
        same interleaver value, modulation and J.83 Annex value.
        
        Additional details and rules to describe the PHY parameter
        dependency is indicated in

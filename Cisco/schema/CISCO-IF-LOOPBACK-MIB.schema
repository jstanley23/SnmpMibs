		readwrite enum cifLLoopbackE	cifLLoopback
		description 	"This object specifies the type of loopback to be established.
        This object is required in order to complete the creation of a
        row in this table. It cannot be modified when the cifLRowStatus
        is active(1).
        
        Possible values are :
                 
        farEndLineLoopback(1): This loopback occurs at the CPE upon
                 receiving a special code from the
                 device which initiates the loopback.
                 Upon receiving the loop activation request
                 code, CPE enters a Line loop mode in which it
                 returns the entire line back to the initiator.
                 The CPE will continue to return the data
                 back to the initiator until it receives
                 a loopback deactivation request code.
        
        farEndPayloadLoopback(2): This loopback occurs at the CPE
                 upon receiving a special code from the
                 device which initiates the loopback.
                 Upon receiving the loop activation request
                 code, CPE enters a Payload loop mode in which it
                 returns the Payload of the received data back 
                 to the initiator.
                 The CPE will continue to return the data
                 back to the initiator until it receives
                 loopback deactivation request code. 
         
        remoteLineLoopback(3): This loopback is established at the 
                 Near-end. In this loopback the entire line is looped 
                 back to the Far-end with a) bit-sequence integrity 
                 maintained,
                 b) no change in framing, and c) no removal of bi-
                 polar violations.    
        
        remotePayloadLoopback(4): This loopback is established at 
                 the Near-end.  In this loopback the signal that is 
                 returned to the Far-end consists of the payload of 
                 the received signal (with bit sequence integrity 
                 retained) and newly generated framing information.                             
         
        localLoopback(5): This is also known as metallic loopback.
                 This loopback is used for checking the
                 internal circuitry of the T3/E3, T1/E1 
                 device.  Only for physical lines.  "

        The value for this object is valid only when
        cifLRowStatus is active(1).
        
        Possible values for this object:
        
        completed(1): Loopback is successfully completed.
        
        inProgress(2): loop up or loop down in progress.
        
        clockOutOfSync(3): When the send and receive clocks are not
                 synchronized.

		readwrite enum cifLFELoopbackDeviceAndCodeE	cifLFELoopbackDeviceAndCode
		description 	"This object specifies the type of the end device and
        the type of mechanism used to establish the loopback.
        Loopback type may not be modified once the farend loopback
        is established. 
        
        Latching Loopback: Latching Loopback is appropriate with
        64 kbit/s DS0-A rate.  Once invoked by a specific activation
        sequence, it typically remains in effect until released by
        another specific code sequence.
        
        non-latching loopback:  Non latching activation involves
        continuous transmission of loopback command codes, followed
        by test data interspersed with command codes.
         
        nonLatchOCUwithOneDevice(1): Non-latching OCU with 
                 one device.
        
        nonLatchOCUwithChainDevices(2): Non-latching OCU 
                 with chain of devices.
        
        nonLatchCSU(3): Non-latching CSU.
        
        nonLatchDSU(4): Non-latching DSU.
        
        latchDS0Drop(5): Latching DS0-DP Drop device.
        
        latchDS0Line(6): Latching DS0-DP line device.
        
        latchOCU(7): Latching OCU.
        
        latchCSU(8): Latching CSU.
        
        latchDSU(9): Latching DSU.
        
        latchDSU(9): Latching DSU .
        
        latchHL96(10): Latching HL96 device.
        
        v54PN127Polynomial(8): For fractional T1.
                 This loopback is based on 
                 CCITT-ITU V.54 and is 
                 used to place either a single 
                 DS0 or a DS0 Bundle(N*DS0) in 
                 loopback mode.
        
        lineInband(12): This is used to loop back the
                 entire T1 line at the far end.
                 This is a repeating 5-bit
                 pattern(00001), i.e. 00001000010001....
                                       
        lineLoopbackESF(13): This loopback results in a full
                 1.544Mbit/s loopback of the 
                 incoming signal at the far end.
                 The loopback is activated (latched) and
                 deactivated by a bit sequence defined in
                 ANSI T1.403 - 1995.
                 This corresponds to Facility Data Link
                 (FDL) loopbacks on a T1 channel.
                 This causes a repeating, 16-bit ESF data
                 link code word (00001110 11111111) to be
                 sent to the remote end requesting that it 
                 enter into a network line loopback.
        
        payloadLoopbackESF(14): This loopback results in 
                 1.536 Mbit/s
                 loopback of the payload of the incoming
                 signal at the far end. The loopback
                 is activated(latched) and deactivated
                 by a bit sequence defined in
                 ANSI T1.403 - 1995.
                 This corresponds to Facility Data Link
                 (FDL) loopbacks on a T1 channel.
                 This causes a repeating, 16-bit ESF data
                 link code word (00010100 11111111) to be
                 sent to the remote end requesting that it 
                 enter into a network payload loopback.
        
        noCode (15): LoopBack is on this device - NearEnd.
        
        lineLoopbackFEAC(16): The FEAC channel is used to request 
                 a line loopback
                 at the Far-end. Loopback activate and 
                 de-activate are specified using the 
                 code-words specified in ANSI T1.404-1994. 
        
        smartJackInband(17): Inband loop code for SmartJack (a Telco owned
                 device that represents the demarcation point of T1 service),
                 Ref: TR-TSY-000312"

## Group and Table Declarations

	table	ccreFeatureElementTable
	description "This table lists all the features and feature groups
        configured on a device.
        
        For each feature it lists all the command(s) contained
        in the feature.
        
        For each feature groups it lists all the features
        contained in the group.
        
        A feature element is either a feature or a feature
        group.
        
        A device may have some predefined features which may
        not be editable by a user. In addition, a device may
        allow a user to define new feature group.
        
        A device implementing this MIB need not implement the
        objects that form a conceptual row in the
        'commonRolesFeatureTable' table defined in the
        CISCO-COMMON-ROLES MIB.

        A device implementing this MIB need not implement the

        This table and the 'commonRoleTable' table both have
        one entry per Role defined on the device. However unlike
        the 'commonRoleTable', this table does not contain any
        scope restriction information. The scope restriction
        information instead is contained in the
        'ccreRoleScopeTable' Table.
        
        If a device implements this this table along with
        'commonRoleTable' a row existing in

	table	ccreRoleScopeTable
	description "This table lists the resources to which a user belonging
        to a role can access. 
        
        A role may be restricted from accessing various
        resources of a device. This table lists the resources
        that a role can access.
        
        If for a role there is no entry in this table, then
        restriction, if any, is determined by the
        ccrePermitAllPolicies object in the ccreRoleTable.
        
        Each resource (VSAN, VLAN or Interface) to which a role
        has access to, has a separate entry in the table.
        For e.g. if a role has access to VLAN 1, 2, 6 and 7;
        VSAN 2, 5 and 8 and interface 2/1 and 2/3, this table
        will have 9 entries, 4 for VSANs, 3 for VLANs and 2 for
        Interfaces.
        
        Entries in this table can be created/deleted using
        ccreRoleScopeRowStatus.
        
        The table provides the same information as
        'commonRoleScopeRestriction', 'commonRoleScope1' and
        'commonRoleScope2' but in a different way.
        
        The object 'commonRoleScope1' and 'commonRoleScope2'
        are 256*8 bit mask with each bit representing a VLAN.
        'commonRoleScope1' identifies VLANS 1 to 2048 whereas
        'commonRoleScope2' identifies VLANS 2049 to 4096.
        
        In this table, there is a separate entry for each VSAN,
        along with separate entry for each VLAN and Interface
        to which a role has access. The purpose of this table
        is to remove the limit of 4096 that are supported by

		description 	"Indicates the desired source of a device's provisioning of
        QoS policy for the whole device.
        
        Actually, the source of an interface's provisioning of QoS
        policy is controlled by two level configurations.  The first
        level is the system level to be the global control for the
        whole device.  This object is for the system level.  The second
        level is for each individual interface.  The 
        qosPrIfAdminPolicySource is for the interface level.  So, the
        value of this object will decide that the value of
        qosPrIfAdminPolicySource can take precedence or not.  If this
        object is configured to cops(3), the value of
        qosPrIfAdminPolicySource has the precedence configuration of
        the interface's provisioning of QoS policy source.
        
        That is to say if this object is configured to local(2), then
        the value of qosPrIfAdminPolicySource will be ignored.  It
        means the provisioning of QoS policy source of all the
        interfaces in this device will be from local information if
        this MIB is configured to local(2).
        
        If this object is configured to cops(3), then the final
        provisioning of QoS policy of an interface is determined by the
        configuration of the qosPrIfAdminPolicySource object of that
        interface.
        
        Changing qosPrIfAdminPolicySource of an interface from cops(3)
        to local(2) while the value of this object is cops(3) makes the
        interface discard the QoS provisioning policy from the COPS
        server and uses the local QoS provisioning policy configuration
        instead."

		description 	"Indicates the operational source of QoS provisioning policy
        for this interface.
        
        When the value of the object qosPrOperPolicySource is
        local(2), the QoS provisioning policy for this interface is
        taken from device's local configuration.  If
        qosPrOperPolicySource is configured to cops(3), the current
        operational source of QoS provisioning policy will depend on
        the configuration of qosPrIfAdminPolicySource object.
        
        Here is the logic.
        
        IF qosPrOperPolicySource == local(2)
        THEN qosPrIfOperPolicySource is local(2)
        ELSE
            IF qosPrOperPolicySource == cops(3)

        For example, if qosPrOperPolicySource shows local(2), although
        the qosPrIfAdminPolicySource is configured cops(3), the QoS
        provisioning policy running on this interface is from local
        device configuration.  It means this object will be local(2).
        
        Note that when qosPrIfAdminPolicySource transitions to
        cops(3) if qosPrOperPolicySource is cops(3),
        qosPrIfOperPolicySource will normally also transition to
        cops(3).  In this situation, it is possible that

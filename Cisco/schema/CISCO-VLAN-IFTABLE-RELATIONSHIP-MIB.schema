	table	cviVlanInterfaceIndexTable
	description "The cviVlanInterfaceIndexTable provides a way to 
        translate a VLAN-id in to an ifIndex, so that 
        the routed VLAN interface's routing configuration 
        can be obtained from interface entry in ipRouteTable.
        
        Note that some routers can have interfaces to multiple
        VLAN management domains, and therefore can have multiple 
        routed VLAN interfaces which connect to different VLANs 
        having the same VLAN-id.  Thus, it is possible to have 
        multiple rows in this table for the same VLAN-id.
        
        The cviVlanInterfaceIndexTable also provides a way
        to find the VLAN-id from an ifTable VLAN's ifIndex."

## Group and Table Declarations

	description "This table contains information on which
        cContextMappingVacmContextName is mapped to
        which VRF, topology, and routing protocol instance.
        
        This table is indexed by SNMP VACM context.
        
        Configuring a row in this table for an SNMP context
        does not require that the context be already defined,
        i.e., a row can be created in this table for a context
        before the corresponding row is created in RFC 3415's
        vacmContextTable.
        
        To create a row in this table, a manager must set
        cContextMappingRowStatus to either 'createAndGo' or
        'createAndWait'.
        
        To delete a row in this table, a manager must set
        cContextMappingRowStatus to 'destroy'."

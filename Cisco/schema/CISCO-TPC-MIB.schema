## Group and Table Declarations

	table	ctpcModuleTable
	description "A table listing the modules on which TPC functionality 
         can be configured by the user. Each such module is
         identified by ctpcModuleId. 
         
         The agent creates an entry in this table on 
         detecting a module that can support TPC 
         functionality. Similarly, it will remove the entry
         when the TPC functionality cannot be supported on
         this module any longer. 
         
         The entry in the ctpcVsanTable can only be created 
         on a module present in this table."

	table	ctpcVsanTable
	description "A table listing all the VSANs for which TPC 
         functionality has been configured by the user. The
         user configures TPC functionality on a per VSAN basis
         by specifying the module, identified by ctpcModuleId,
         on which to configure TPC and the VSAN number.
         
         An entry can be created in this table only if an
         entry exists in ctpcModuleTable for this module.
         If a management application attempts to create
         a row in this table corresponding to a module that 
         does not exist in ctpcModuleTable table then the 
         agent would respond with an error-status set to
          'inconsistentValue'.
                          
         Once an entry is created, even if this module no 
         longer exists in the ctpcModuleTable, still 
         this entry is not deleted. The entry can only be 
         deleted by setting ctpcVsanRowStatus to 'delete'."

	table	ctpcTargetTable
	description "A list of all the TPC targets that are configured 
         on this module and on this VSAN. There can be more
         than one TPC target in the same VSAN on a module.
         The number of TPC targets is implementation specific.
         Each TPC target has a unique node world-wide-name, 
         identified by ctpcTargetNodeName and a unique port
         world-wide-name, identified by ctpcTargetPortName. 
         Each TPC target exposes a single LUN (LUN 0) that is
         XCOPY capable and is only concerned with moving data
         in its own VSAN.
         
         Once an entry is created in ctpcVsanTable, one or 
         more entries are created in this table by agent.
         Similarly the entries in this table are deleted
         when the entry with the same ctpcModuleId and

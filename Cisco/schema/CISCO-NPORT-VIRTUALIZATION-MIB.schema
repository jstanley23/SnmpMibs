		description 	"This object enables/disables automatic rebalancing of the
        server to external interface assignments such that number of 
        server interface assigned to the external interfaces are 
        evenly distributed as much as possible. Redistribution of the 
        server interfaces are done with the constraints of VSANs 
        assigned to the interfaces and traffic maps specifying which 
        external interface a server interface can take. 
        
        When this feature is enabled or when an external interface comes
        up, then the switch reevaluates the current distribution
        and determines if a rebalancing is required. 
        
        During the move of server interface from one external 
        interface to another, there is a temporary traffic disruption 
        for that server interface."

        The list should contain at least one interface and at most

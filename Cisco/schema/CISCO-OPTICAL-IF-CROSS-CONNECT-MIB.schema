	table	coifccCrossConnectTable
	description "This table contains configuration and state information of
        point-to-point and point-to-multipoint interface
        cross-connects.
        
        Each entry in the table models two bi-directional interfaces on
        opposite sides of a bi-directional cross-connect.
        
        For a point-to-point cross-connect, there can be up to four
        entries in the table with the same value of coifccCcIndex, due
        to the presence of protection interfaces.  
        All four entries are associated with each other due to
        APS configuration (for now, this would be done through
        the CISCO-APS-MIB). If both sides A and B are configured
        for 1+1 APS protection, and a cross-connect between
        interfaces A and B is created, then the following
        cross-connect entries will be present:
        
        The cross-connect with coifccCcKind value 'provisioned' is the
        one that is created through cross-connect configuration and the
        cross-connects with coifccCcKind value 'protection' are those
        that are created automatically due to APS configuration.
        
        Low interface    High interface        coifccCcKind
        
        A                B                     provisioned
        A                B'                    protection
        A'               B                     protection
        A'               B'                    protection
        
        When the cross-connect between A and B is deleted, all four
        cross-connect entries will disappear.
        
        Each side of the point-to-point cross-connect can have up to
        two interfaces, for example when SONET 1+1 Automatic
        Protection Switching (APS) is used.  Any one of the four
        entries of a point-to-point cross-connect can be created,
        and the remaining three entries will be created
        automatically. However only the 'provisioned' entry can be
        explicitly deleted, which also causes the corresponding
        'protection' entries to be deleted.  Note that use of the
        word 'protection' is different from its usage in SONET 1+1 APS.
        In particular, there is no requirement that the 'provisioned'
        cross-connect must be between the SONET 'working' interfaces.
        
        
        A point-to-multipoint connection consists of one root and
        many leaves.  Copies of the traffic received at the root
        interface are transmitted out each of the leaf interfaces.
        
        For a point-to-multipoint cross-connect with N leafs,
        the manager creates N 'provisioned' entries in this table.
        Where N is determined by the manager based on some application.
        In the presence of  APS configuration, the same
        point-to-multipoint (N leafs) cross-connect, in addition
        to having N 'provisioned' entries in this table, can have upto
        an additional 3N 'protection' entries automatically configured.
        
        The terms low and high are chosen to represent numerical
        ordering of the two interfaces associated with a cross-connect.
        That is, the interface with the lower value of ifIndex is
        termed 'low', while the other interface associated with the
        cross-connect is termed 'high'.  This terminology is used to
        provide directional information; for example, the
        coifccCcL2HOperStatus applies to the low->high direction, and
        coifccCcH2LOperStatus applies to the high->low direction."

        agent.
        
        For point-to-point cross-connects, the only sets allowed on
        this object are during initial row creation, and to change the
        value of this object from 'protection' to 'provisioned', which
        automatically changes the coifccCcKind value of the
        'provisioned' cross-connect with the same coifccCcIndex value

                user, management, or control plane intervention.  In
                particular, this is used to represent fixed interface
                cross-connects due to the presence of entities such as
                optical add/drop multiplexers.
            dynamic(3)
                Created by request from a control plane (e.g. from

                entry for the first interface in the pair is being
                created.  Such an entry cannot be deleted directly.
                It is deleted when the cross-connect entry containing

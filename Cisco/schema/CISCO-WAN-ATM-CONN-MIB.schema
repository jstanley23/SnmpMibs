        When a connection gets deleted, this resource gets 
        released into a free pool. When a new endpoint is added
        (different ifIndex, cwaChanVpi & cwaChanVci), the switch may
        re-assign this resource.
        
        Thus all connections in a switch would have an unique
        cwaChanIdentifier. Since the number of resources in the

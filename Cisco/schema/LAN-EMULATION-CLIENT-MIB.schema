## Group and Table Declarations

	table	lecConfigTable
	description "A table describing all of the LAN Emulation Clients
         implemented by this host.  Each LE Client has a row
         in the MIB-II/RFC 1573 Interfaces table (describing
         the emulated packet interface it presents to higher
         layers).  Each LE Client also has a row in this and
         other LEC MIB tables (describing its interface with
         other LAN Emulation components).
        
         This table contains configuration variables.  Three
         extension tables contain client status, performance
         statistics, and information about control/multicast
         VCCs.
        
         Unlike hardware ports, LE Clients can be created by
         management.  However, the RFC 1573 Interfaces table
         does not directly support row creation.  Therefore,
         creating or deleting a row in the lecConfigTable is
         defined to have the side effect of creating or
         deleting corresponding rows in
        
             -  the MIB-II / RFC 1573 Interfaces table,
             -  the 'lecMappingTable',
             -  the 'lecStatusTable',
             -  the 'lecServerVccTable',
             -  the 'lecStatisticsTable', and
             -  any other dependent tables
        
         New Interfaces table rows for LAN Emulation Clients
         always have 'ifAdminStatus' set to 'down'.
        
        
         A Note On Indexing:
         -------------------
         Most of the tables in this MIB are indexed in whole
         or in part by 'lecIndex' - not by 'ifIndex'.
        
         Why is there a separate index?
        
         Traditionally, ifIndex values are chosen by agents,
         and are permitted to change across restarts.  Using
         ifIndex to index lecConfigTable could complicate
         row creation and/or cause interoperability problems
         (if each agent had special restrictions on ifIndex).
         Having a separate index avoids these problems.      "
	characteristics "-K ONE"

		notaccessible int	lecIndex
		description 	"A value which uniquely identifies this conceptual
         row in the lecConfigTable.
        
         If the conceptual row identified by this value of
         lecIndex is recreated following an agent restart,
         the same value of lecIndex must be used to identify
         the recreated row.  (However, the Interfaces table
         index associated with the client may change.)"

		description 	"This object lets network managers create and delete
         LAN Emulation Clients, on systems that support this
         optional capability.
        
         It does not control Joins and Terminations; they are
         controlled by 'ifAdminStatus'.  However, taking rows
         out of service will have the side effect of changing
         their 'ifAdminStatus' values to 'down', thus causing
         any active emulated LAN connections to be terminated.
        
         Within each conceptual lecConfigTable row, objects
         which are writable may be modified regardless of the
         value of lecRowStatus.  It is not necessary to set a
         row's status to 'notInService' first.
        
         When creating a LAN Emulation Client, it is up to the
         management station to determine a suitable 'lecIndex'.
         To facilitate interoperability, agents should not put
         any restrictions on the 'lecIndex' beyond the obvious
         ones that it be valid and unused.

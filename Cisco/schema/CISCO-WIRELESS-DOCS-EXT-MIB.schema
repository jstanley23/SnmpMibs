		description 	"To ensure fairness, at the upstream, the HE will throttle
           the rate of bandwidth  grants, such that the flow never 
           gets more than its provisioned peak rate in bps. 
           Similarly at the downstream, HE controls the packets 
           sent such that flow never gets more than its provisioned
           peak rate in bps.
        
           There are two directions for every Service Id (Sid) traffic: 
           downstream and upstream. Each direction is called a service
           flow here and is assigned one token bucket with chosen
           algorithm. 
        
           The enumerations for the rate limiting algorithm are:
            noRateLimit(1): The rate limiting is disabled. No rate
                            limiting.
            oneSecBurst(2): Bursty 1 second token bucket algorithm.
            carLike(3)    : Average token usage (CAR-like) algorithm 
            wgtExPacketDiscard(4) : Weighted excess packet discard 
                                    algorithm.
            shaping(5): token bucket algorithm with shaping
        
           Upstream supports all the above except 
            wgtExtPacketDiscard(4).
        
           Downstream supports all the above rate-limiting algorithms.
        
           Token bucket algorithm with shaping is the
           default algorithm for upstream.
        
           Bursty 1 second token bucket algorithm is the 
           default algorithm for downstream.
        
           Each algorithm is described as below:
             No rate limiting: 
               The rate limiting process is disabled and no checking 
               against the maximum bandwidth allowed. 
        
             Bursty 1 second token bucket rate limiting algorithm: 
               In this algorithm, at the start of every 1 second interval, 
               a service flow's token usage is reset to 0, and every time 
               the modem for that service flow sends a request (upstream) / 
               packet (downstream) the upstream/downstream bandwidth 
               token usage is incremented by the size of the 
               request/packet sent. As long as the service flow's bandwidth 
               token usage is less than the maximum bandwidth in bits 
               per second (peak rate limit) its QoS service class 
               allows, the request/packets will not be restricted. 
               Once the service flow has sent more than its peak rate in the 
               one second interval, it is prevented from sending more 
               data by rejecting request (upstream) or dropping 
               packets (downstream). This is expected to slow down
               the higher layer sources. The token usage counter gets 
               reset to 0 after the 1 second interval has elapsed. The 
               modem for that service flow is free to send more data up to the 
               peak rate limit in the new 1 second interval that follows.  
        
             Average token usage (Cisco CAR like) algorithm: 
               This algorithm maintains a continuous average of the 
               burst token usage of a service flow. There is no sudden 
               refilling of tokens every 1 second interval. Every time a 
               request/packet is to be handled, the scheduler tries to see 
               how much time has elapsed since last transmission, and 
               computes the number of tokens accumulated by this service flow 
               at its QoS class peak rate. If burst usage of the service flow 
               is less than tokens accumulated, the burst usage is reset to 0 
               and request/packet is forwarded. If the service flow has 
               accumulated fewer tokens than its burst usage, the burst usage 
               shows an outstanding balance usage after decrementing by the 
               tokens accumulated. In such cases, the request/packet is still 
               forwarded, provided the service flow's outstanding usage does 
               not exceed peak rate limit of its QoS class. If outstanding 
               burst usage exceeds the peak rate of the class, the service 
               flow is given some token credit up to a certain maximum credit 
               limit and the request/packet is forwarded. The request/packet 
               is dropped when outstanding usage exceeds peak rate and maximum 
               credit has been used up by this service flow. This algorithm 
               tracks long term average bandwidth usage of the service flow 
               and controls this average usage at the peak rate limit.
        
             Weighted excess packet discard algorithm:
               This rate limiting algorithm is only available as an option 
               for downstream rate limiting. The algorithm is to maintain an 
               weighted exponential moving average of the loss rate of a 
               service flow over time. The los"

           then grants/packets of the flow will be buffered for a
           longer period of time even though the flow is rate exceeded.
           This means fewer chances of drops for such rate exceeded 
           flow. However, too large a max shaping delay can result in
           quick drainage of packet buffers at the HE, since several 
           packets will be in the shaping (delay) queue waiting for 
           their proper transmission time. Another important point to
           note is that delaying a flow's packets (especially TCP 
           flows) for extended periods of time may be counter-
           productive, since the higher protocol layers may assume
           a packet loss after a certain amount of time.
        
           The maximum shaping delay is only applied to rate limit

           case, you will be allowed to set the value to na(1) only.
        
           If the token count is less than the size of request/packet, HE

           tokens would be available. If the shaping delay time is greater

                          do any operation.

                               at the time when the command becomes
                               active.

                                   a RNG-RSP message with channel

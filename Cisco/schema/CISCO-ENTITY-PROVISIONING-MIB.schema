## Group and Table Declarations

	table	ceProvContainerTable
	description "This table extends some entries in the entPhysicalTable
        (see ENTITY-MIB for further details).  A entry appears in
        this table for a physical entity matching the following
        criteria:
        
        1)  Its entPhysicalClass object has a value of 'container';
        
        2)  It can contain one (but not multiple) physical entity;
            and,
        
        3)  It supports provisioning."

		description 	"This object represents the equipment status of the container:
        
        'unequipped'    The container neither holds a physical entity,
                        nor has it been provisioned to hold a physical
                        entity.
        
        'provisioned'   The container does not hold a physical entity
                        However, it has been provisioned to hold a
                        physical entity of a particular type.  This
                        physical entity appears in the entPhysicalTable
                        as a child of the container.
        
        'mismatched'    The container holds a valid physical entity that
                        does not match the type of physical entity for
                        which the container has been previously
                        provisioned.
        
        'invalid'       The container holds a recognized physical entity
                        that the container is not capable of supporting,
                        or the container holds an unrecognized physical
                        entity.
        
        'equipped'      The container holds a valid physical entity for
                        which the container has been previously
                        provisioned to hold.
        
        'failed'        The container holds a valid physical entity that
                        has become totally inoperable and incapable of
                        providing service."

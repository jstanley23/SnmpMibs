## Group and Table Declarations

	table	virtualNwIfTable
	description "This table contains one entry for each local virtual  
         interface to a VSAN or VLAN, at most one such interface 
         per processor on a Supervisor or Line card managed by 
         the agent. Each such processor will have an entry in  
         the entPhysicalTable ( from ENTITY-MIB ) and will have a  
         unique PhysicalIndex. For e.g. if Line card has  
         2 processors on it then each processor will have a 
         entry in the entPhysicaltable and each will have  
         unique PhysicalIndex. It is possible that there can be 
         multiple VSAN's or VLAN's per processor, but the  
         network manager can create only one virtual interface 
         for a VSAN and only one for a VLAN per physical entity 
         i.e. per processor on the card. 
         Note:Processor is represented as a physical entity in 
         the entPhysicalTable. 
         Each such interface has a unique ifIndex assigned by  
         the agent. When requested to create an entry in this 
         table, the agent also creates a corresponding entry in 
         the ifTable of IF-MIB and also an entry in the  
         cieIfInterfaceTable of CISCO-IF-EXTENSION-MIB.  Next,  
         the agent fills in the values of virtualNwIfIndex, after 
         which the creation of the entry in this table completes. 
         The ciiIPIfAddressTable of CISCO-IP-IF-MIB can be used 
         to configure the IP addresses.  The ifTable and this 
         table can be used to monitor the interface.  
        
         Entries in this table are created by network managers. 
         But the entries can be deleted either by the network 
         managers or will be deleted by the agent if the 
         corresponding VSAN or VLAN is deleted.  
         An entry will be allowed to be created only if the  
         corresponding VSAN or VLAN has been created. 
         The ifType for an created interface of type 'vsan(1)' 
         will be 'fibreChannel(56)' and of type 'vlan(2)' would 
         be  'ethernetCsmacd(6)'. "

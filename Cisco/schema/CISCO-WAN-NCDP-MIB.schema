		description 	"The interval at which NCDP configuration PDUs ('Hellos') are to be

        The message interval directly affects the convergence time of

                the time a configuration PDU is spent being processed 
                in each device. 
        Thus if transmission delays and processing delays are
        both close to 0, the convergence time is approximately 
        ( max network diameter * message interval ) milliseconds.

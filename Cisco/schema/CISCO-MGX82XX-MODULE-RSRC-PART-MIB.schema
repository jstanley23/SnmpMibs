          noPartition(1): all controllers compete for the totoal

                   to each controller is fixed but no reservation on
                   each port. The number for each controller is

        such as (G)LCN (if the object cardLcnPartitionType is

        par(1) -  Portable Auto Route(PAR). This is a VSI Master controller
            implementing Cisco Proprietary protocol for network
            routing and topology in a Network containing only 
        Cisco Switches.
        
        pnni(2) - Private Network-to-Network Interface (PNNI) controller.
        The PNNI protocol is used between private ATM Switches
        and between groups of ATM switches. This protocol is 
        defined for distributing topology information between
        switches and clusters of switches.
        
        tag(3)  - Label(tag) Switch Controller(TSC).The LSC Implements MPLS
            (Multi Protocol Label Switching) protocol. The LSC is 
        a router which is capable of controlling the operation
        of a separate ATM switch so that the two of them 
                   together function as a single ATM-LSR
                   (ATM Label Switch Router).
        The LSC controls the operation of the ATM Switch
        using a 'Switch Control Protocol', which allows the
        LSC to setup and remove cross-connects on the ATM
        switch, to discover the configuration and capabilities
        of the controlled switch, and to gather statistics from
        the controlled switch."

		description 	"To facilitate the provisioning of access control by a

        Control Model (RFC 2575, VACM) for tables in which
        multiple users may need to independently create or
        modify entries, the initial index is used as an 'owner
        index'.  Such an initial index has a syntax of
        SnmpAdminString, and can thus be trivially mapped to a
        securityName or groupName as defined in VACM, in
        accordance with a security policy.
        
        When used in conjunction with such a security policy all
        entries in the table belonging to a particular user (or
        group) will have the same value for this initial index.
        For a given user's entries in a particular table, the
        object identifiers for the information in these entries
        will have the same subidentifiers (except for the
        'column' subidentifier) up to the end of the encoded
        owner index. To configure VACM to permit access to this
        portion of the table, one would create
        vacmViewTreeFamilyTable entries with the value of
        vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree including the owner index
        portion, and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask 'wildcarding' the
        column subidentifier.  More elaborate configurations

        One or more entries are added to the
        lookupResultsTable when a lookup operation,
        as reflected by an lookupCtlEntry, completes
        successfully.  All entries related to a

        that the associating lookupCtlOperStatus
        object is transitioned to completed(2).
        
        The number of entries added depends on the
        results determined for a particular lookup
        operation.  All entries associated with an
        lookupCtlEntry are removed when the
        lookupCtlEntry is deleted.
        
        A remote host can be multi-homed and have more
        than one IP address associated with it
        (gethostbyname results) and/or it can have more
        than one symbolic name (gethostbyaddr results).
        
        The gethostbyaddr function is called with a
        host address as its parameter and is used
        primarily to determine a symbolic name to
        associate with the host address.  Entries in
        the lookupResultsTable MUST be made for each
        host name returned.  The official host name MUST
        be assigned a lookupResultsIndex of 1.
        
        The gethostbyname function is called with a
        symbolic host name and is used primarily to

	description "The (conceptual) table containing information
         for Switch Threshold Groups. When cells are
         queued in the switch for a direction of cell
         traffic on an ATM connection (VC or VP), several
         functions related to queueing are dictated
         by the congestion state (fullness) of the Threshold
         Group. Each connection queue is a member of
         a Threshold Group.
         These functions include:
         - The limit on the number of cells that can
           be queued. Cells exceeding this limit are
           discarded.
         - The discard threshold, used for CLP/EPD
           discard when the fullness of the queue exceeds
           the threshold.
         - The marking threshold, used for EFCI marking.
         Each Threshold Group has a maximum number of cells
         that can be resident in it at any one time. The
         number of cells in a Group consists of the number
         of cells in all the queues that are a member of
         the Group. As the number of cells in a Group
         approaches the maximum number for the Group,
         the queue limits may be decreased. This limits
         the share of  buffering available to each
         connection as cell-memory is used.
        
         On the Catalyst8540MSR platform, there are a
         maximum of 8 switching modules. Each switching
         module services a certain group of ports (this
         mapping is fixed in hardware). Each module also
         has its own cell memory (for per VC queueing),
         and hence performs its own congestion control,
         independent of any other switching module.
         Each switching module has its own set of
         Switch Threshold Groups, which are

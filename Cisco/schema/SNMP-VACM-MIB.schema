## Group and Table Declarations

	table	vacmContextTable
	description "The table of locally available contexts.
        
         This table provides information to SNMP Command
         Generator applications so that they can properly
         configure the vacmAccessTable to control access to
         all contexts at the SNMP entity.
        
         This table may change dynamically if the SNMP entity
         allows that contexts are added/deleted dynamically
         (for instance when its configuration changes). Such
         changes would happen only if the management
         instrumentation at that SNMP entity recognizes more
         (or fewer) contexts.
        
         The presence of entries in this table and of entries
         in the vacmAccessTable are independent.  That is, a
         context identified by an entry in this table is not
         necessarily referenced by any entries in the
         vacmAccessTable; and the context(s) referenced by an
         entry in the vacmAccessTable does not necessarily
         currently exist and thus need not be identified by an
         entry in this table.
        
         This table must be made accessible via the default
         context so that Command Responder applications have
         a standard way of retrieving the information.
        
         This table is read-only. It cannot be configured via
         SNMP."

	table	vacmAccessTable
	description "The table of access rights for groups.
        
         Each entry is indexed by a groupName, a contextPrefix,
         a securityModel and a securityLevel.  To determine
         whether access is allowed, one entry from this table
         needs to be selected and the proper viewName from that
         entry must be used for access control checking.
        
         To select the proper entry, follow these steps:
        
         1) the set of possible matches is formed by the
            intersection of the following sets of entries:
              the set of entries with identical vacmGroupName
              the union of these two sets:
               - the set with identical vacmAccessContextPrefix
               - the set of entries with vacmAccessContextMatch
                 value of 'prefix' and matching
        
        
        
        
        
                 vacmAccessContextPrefix
              intersected with the union of these two sets:
               - the set of entries with identical
                 vacmSecurityModel
               - the set of entries with vacmSecurityModel
                 value of 'any'
              intersected with the set of entries with
              vacmAccessSecurityLevel value less than or equal
              to the requested securityLevel
        
         2) if this set has only one member, we're done
            otherwise, it comes down to deciding how to weight
            the preferences between ContextPrefixes,
            SecurityModels, and SecurityLevels as follows:
            a) if the subset of entries with securityModel
               matching the securityModel in the message is
               not empty, then discard the rest.
            b) if the subset of entries with
               vacmAccessContextPrefix matching the contextName
               in the message is not empty,
               then discard the rest
            c) discard all entries with ContextPrefixes shorter
               than the longest one remaining in the set
            d) select the entry with the highest securityLevel
        
         Please note that for securityLevel noAuthNoPriv, all

	table	vacmViewTreeFamilyTable
	description "Locally held information about families of subtrees
         within MIB views.
        
         Each MIB view is defined by two sets of view subtrees:
           - the included view subtrees, and
           - the excluded view subtrees.
         Every such view subtree, both the included and the
         excluded ones, is defined in this table.
        
         To determine if a particular object instance is in
         a particular MIB view, compare the object instance's
         OBJECT IDENTIFIER with each of the MIB view's active
         entries in this table.  If none match, then the
         object instance is not in the MIB view.  If one or
         more match, then the object instance is included in,
         or excluded from, the MIB view according to the
         value of vacmViewTreeFamilyType in the entry whose
         value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree has the most
         sub-identifiers.  If multiple entries match and have
         the same number of sub-identifiers (when wildcarding
         is specified with the value of vacmViewTreeFamilyMask),
         then the lexicographically greatest instance of
         vacmViewTreeFamilyType determines the inclusion or
         exclusion.
        
         An object instance's OBJECT IDENTIFIER X matches an
         active entry in this table when the number of
         sub-identifiers in X is at least as many as in the
         value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree for the entry,
         and each sub-identifier in the value of
         vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree matches its corresponding
         sub-identifier in X.  Two sub-identifiers match
         either if the corresponding bit of the value of
         vacmViewTreeFamilyMask for the entry is zero (the
         'wild card' value), or if they are equal.
        
         A 'family' of subtrees is the set of subtrees defined
         by a particular combination of values of
         vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask.
         In the case where no 'wild card' is defined in the
         vacmViewTreeFamilyMask, the family of subtrees reduces
         to a single subtree.
        
         When creating or changing MIB views, an SNMP Command
        
        
        
        
        
         Generator application should utilize the
         vacmViewSpinLock to try to avoid collisions. See
         DESCRIPTION clause of vacmViewSpinLock.
        
         When creating MIB views, it is strongly advised that
         first the 'excluded' vacmViewTreeFamilyEntries are
         created and then the 'included' entries.
        
         When deleting MIB views, it is strongly advised that
         first the 'included' vacmViewTreeFamilyEntries are
         deleted and then the 'excluded' entries.
        
         If a create for an entry for instance-level access
         control is received and the implementation does not
         support instance-level granularity, then an
         inconsistentName error must be returned."

         string value (extended if necessary, see below)
         corresponding to the (8*i - 7)-th sub-identifier, and
         the least significant bit of the i-th octet of this
         octet string corresponding to the (8*i)-th
         sub-identifier, where i is in the range 1 through 16.
        
         Each bit of this bit mask specifies whether or not
         the corresponding sub-identifiers must match when
         determining if an OBJECT IDENTIFIER is in this
         family of view subtrees; a '1' indicates that an
         exact match must occur; a '0' indicates 'wild card',
         i.e., any sub-identifier value matches.
        
         Thus, the OBJECT IDENTIFIER X of an object instance
         is contained in a family of view subtrees if, for

           the i-th sub-identifier of X is equal to the i-th
           sub-identifier of the value of
           vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree.
        
         If the value of this bit mask is M bits long and
         there are more than M sub-identifiers in the
         corresponding instance of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree,
         then the bit mask is extended with 1's to be the
         required length.
        
         Note that when the value of this object is the
         zero-length string, this extension rule results in
         a mask of all-1's being used (i.e., no 'wild card'),
         and the family of view subtrees is the one view
         subtree uniquely identified by the corresponding

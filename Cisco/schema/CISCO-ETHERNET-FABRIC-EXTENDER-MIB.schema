## Group and Table Declarations

	table	cefexBindingTable
	description "This table has the binding information of a
        'Fabric Port' to 'Fabric Extender' on a 
        'Extender Core Switch'.  Each entry in this table 
        configures one fabric port.  
        
        A core switch does not accept fabric extender 
        connections into its fabric ports unless the
        extender matches an entry in this table.  Once matched,
        the extender is identified by the instances of the
        cefexBindingExtenderIndex in the matching row.
        
        The matching criteria and values to match for 
        each fabric extender are specified in a row in the
        cefexConfigTable.  Each row in the cefexConfigTable 
        is indexed by cefexBindingExtenderIndex.  Each row
        in this table has an unique cefexBindingExtenderIndex
        value, therefore, providing the linkage between
        the two tables. 
        
        It is expected that user first creates a row in
        the cefexConfigTable for a specific cefexBindingExtenderIndex,
        followed by creation of the corresponding row in
        this table for the same cefexBindingExtenderIndex..
        If a row in this table is created and if there is
        no corresponding row created in the cefexConfigTable, 
        then the agent will automatically create a row in the 
        cefexConfigTable with instance of every object in this
        row initialized to the DEFVAL."

		notaccessible int	cefexBindingInterfaceOnCoreSwitch
		description 	"This object is the index that uniquely identifies an entry in
        the cefexBindingTable.  The value of this object is an IfIndex
        to a fabric port.  By creating a row in this table for 
        a particular core switch interface, the user enables that 
        core switch interface to accept a fabric extender. By default, 
        a core switch interface does not have an entry in this table 
        and consequently does not accept/respond to discovery 
        requests from fabric extenders."

		readwrite gauge	cefexBindingExtenderIndex
		description 	"The value of cefexBindingExtenderIndex used as an
        Index into the cefexConfigTable to select the Fabric
        Extender configuration for this binding entry.  However,
        a value in this table does not imply that an instance with
        this value exists in the cefexConfigTable.
        
        If an entry corresponding to the value of this object does
        not exist in cefexConfigTable, the system default behavior
        (using DEFVAL values for all the configuration objects as
        defined in cefexConfigTable) of the Fabric Extender is 
        used for this binding entry.
        
        Since an extender may connect to a core switch via
        multiple interfaces or fabric ports, it is important all 
        the binding entries configuring the same fabric extender 
        are configured with the same extender Index.  Every 
        interface on different fabric extender connecting into
        the same core switch is differentiated by its extender id. 
        To refer to a port on the extender, an example 
        representation may be extender/slot/port.  Extender id 
        values 1-99 are reserved. For example, reserved values can
        be used to identify the core switch and its line cards in 
        the extender/slot/port naming scheme.
        
        cefexBindingExtenderIndex identifies further attributes
        of a fabric extender via the cefexConfigTable.  A user
        may choose to identify a fabric extender by
        specifying its value of cefexConfigExtendername and/or
        other attributes."

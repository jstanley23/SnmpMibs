	table	ifStackTable
	description "The table containing information on the relationships
        between the multiple sub-layers of network interfaces.  In
        particular, it contains information on which sub-layers run
        'on top of' which other sub-layers, where each sub-layer
        corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable.  For
        example, when the sub-layer with ifIndex value x runs over
        the sub-layer with ifIndex value y, then this table
        contains:
        
          ifStackStatus.x.y=active
        
        For each ifIndex value, I, which identifies an active
        interface, there are always at least two instantiated rows
        in this table associated with I.  For one of these rows, I
        is the value of ifStackHigherLayer; for the other, I is the
        value of ifStackLowerLayer.  (If I is not involved in
        multiplexing, then these are the only two rows associated
        with I.)
        
        For example, two rows exist even for an interface which has

	table	ifTestTable
	description "This table contains one entry per interface.  It defines
        objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent
        to test an interface for various faults.  Tests for an
        interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that
        interface.  After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult
        can be read to determine the outcome.  If an agent can not
        perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate.  The
        object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test-
        specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific)
        information concerning the outcome of the test.  Only one
        test can be in progress on each interface at any one time.
        If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the
        second test is rejected.  Some agents may reject a test when
        a prior test is active on another interface.
        
        Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain
        'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the
        interface to be tested.  This is accomplished with the
        ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows:
        
        try_again:
          get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus)
          while (ifTestStatus != notInUse)
              /*
               * Loop while a test is running or some other
               * manager is configuring a test.
               */
              short delay
              get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus)
          }
        
          /*
           * Is not being used right now -- let's compete
           * to see who gets it.
           */
          lock_value = ifTestId
        
          if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse,
        
                   ifTestOwner = 'my-IP-address') == FAILURE)
              /*
               * Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go
               * try again
               */
              goto try_again;
        
          /*
           * I have the lock
           */
          set up any test parameters.
        
          /*
           * This starts the test
           */
          set(ifTestType = test_to_run);
        
          wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult
        
          when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult
               agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse'
        
          retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId
        
          if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid
        
        A manager station first retrieves the value of the
        appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically
        repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of
        ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'.  The manager station then tries
        to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just
        retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the
        corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating
        itself.  If the set operation succeeds then the manager has
        obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the
        ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the
        semantics of TestAndIncr).  Failure of the set operation
        indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of
        the ifTestEntry.
        
        Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be
        setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType.
        On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to
        'notInUse'.  Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the
        results.  In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests
        by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be
        a possibility that the first test's results might be
        overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first
        results being read.  This unlikely circumstance can be
        detected by a network manager retrieving ifTestId at the
        same time as retrieving the test results, and ensuring that
        the results are for the desired request.
        
        If ifTestType is not set within an abnormally long period of
        time after ownership is obtained, the agent should time-out
        the manager, and reset the value of the ifTestStatus object
        back to 'notInUse'.  It is suggested that this time-out
        period be 5 minutes.
        
        In general, a management station must not retransmit a
        request to invoke a test for which it does not receive a
        response; instead, it properly inspects an agent's MIB to
        determine if the invocation was successful.  Only if the
        invocation was unsuccessful, is the invocation request
        retransmitted.
        
        Some tests may require the interface to be taken off-line in
        order to execute them, or may even require the agent to
        reboot after completion of the test.  In these
        circumstances, communication with the mana"

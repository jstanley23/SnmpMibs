		readwrite enum cwapRerouteE	cwapReroute
		description 	"The management station uses this object to trigger the
        re-routing of the party.
        
        * Rerouting takes effect, when this object is set to true(1).
          When set to false(2), no action is taken.

          to this variable. 
        
        * During reroute operation, the 'cwapOperStatus' will contain
          the value 'fail'. Upon successful completion of reroute,
          the 'cwapOperStatus' will change to the value 'ok'. If the  
          reroute operation failed, the 'cwapOperStatus' will stay in   
          'fail'. The management station should query the 
          'cwapOperStatus' to decide if a reroute request is 
          successful or not."

		readonly gauge	cwapIdentifier
		description 	"An arbitrary integer which serves to 
        distinguish all parties on a node.
        This value is assigned by the managed
        system when a party is added.
        
        The use of this variable is implementation specific."

		readonly gauge	cwapUploadCounter
		description 	"This counter is used by the management station to 
        determine if a party had been modified and requires 
        further action from management station.
        
        The use of this variable is implementation specific.
        
        This functionality is conventionally achieved by time
        stamping using a time-of-day clock. However, in switches
        where time-of-day clock is not available, the following
        scheme is used:
        
        The upload counter is incremented, when:
        
        * assignment of a party to a cwapIdentifier. This
          happens when a party is added and assigned this
          cwapIdentifier.
        * de-assignment of connection from a cwapIdentifier. This
          happens when a connection is deleted. 
        * When there is a status change done to this party."

		readwrite enum cwapRowStatusE	cwapRowStatus
		description 	"This object is used to create, modify or delete an entry
        in the ciscoWanAtmPartyTable.
        
        * A row may be created using the 'CreateAndGo' option. When
          the row is successfully created, the RowStatus would be
          set to 'active' by the agent.

		description 	"This object is used to facilitate modification of 
        IGMP Filter Editor Group in the CISCO-IGMP-FILTER-MIB  
        module by multiple managers.  In particular, it is  
        useful when modifying the value of the cIgmpFilterEditor  
        object.  
        
        The procedure for modifying the cIgmpFilterEditor  
        object is as follows:  
        
            1.  Retrieve the value of cIgmpFilterEditSpinLock and  
                of object within cIgmpFilterEditor group.  
        
            2.  Generate new values for 'writeable' objects 
                in the cIgmpFilterEditor group except for  
                cIgmpFilterEditSpinLock object. 
        
            3.  Set the value of cIgmpFilterEditSpinLock to the  
                retrieved value, and the value of objects in  
                cIgmpFilterEditor to the new value. If the set 
                fails for the cIgmpFilterEditSpinLock object, 
                go back to step 1.  
        
        The cIgmpFilterApplyStatus and cIgmpFilterEditSpinLock  
        should be read together by NMS to make sure that the  
        result is associated with its configuration request. 
        
        To add/delete or modify a profile ( through cIgmpFilterEditor 
        objects ) following procedure may be followed as an example.: 
        
            1.  GET(cIgmpFilterEditSpinLock.0) and save in sValue. 
            2.  SET(cIgmpFilterEditSpinLock.0 = sValue, 
                    cIgmpFilterEditProfileIndex.0 = validProfileNumber, 
                    cIgmpFilterEditStartAddress.0 = validStartAddress, 
                    cIgmpFilterEditEndAddress.0 = validEndAddress, 
                    cIgmpFilterEditOperation.0 =  validOperation) 
            3.  If the SET in step 2 is not successful go back 
                to step 1. 
            4.  If the SET in step 2 is successful, user should  
                GET(cIgmpFilterEditSpinLock.0) and  
                GET(cIgmpFilterApplyStatus.0) simultaneously. 
        
            5.  The cIgmpFilterApplyStatus.0 reflects the outcome of 
                step 2 only if 
                cIgmpFilterEditSpinLock.0 = sValue + 1 or 
                cIgmpFilterEditSpinLock.0 = 0 if sValue reaches 
                value at which cIgmpFilterEditSpinLock wraps  
                around."

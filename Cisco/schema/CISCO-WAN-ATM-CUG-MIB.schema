        other members in the same CUG.
        
        When this variable is set to incoming(2), it means this
        member cannot receive incoming calls from other members
        in the same CUG.

		description 	"This variable decides whether 'incoming access'

		readwrite enum cwaOutgoingAccessE	cwaOutgoingAccess
		description 	"This variable decides whether 'outgoing access' 
        is allowed for a CUG user. 
        
        The 'outgoing access' allows a member of a CUG to make

        other CUG members that allow 'incoming access'.
        
        When the value is set to notAllowed(1), the 'outgoinging 
        access' is not allowed. 
         
        When the value is set to allowedPerCall(2), the 
        'outgoing access' is granted on a per call basis. This
        means for each call, the 'outgoing access' request must
        be part of the call SETUP message. 
        
        When the value is set to allowedPermanently(3),  
        the 'outgoing access' is allowed for all calls.

        system, this variable has a value of notAllowed(1)."

		readwrite int	cwaPreferentialCug
		description 	"The CUG index of the 'preferential CUG' for this address.
        There can be only one 'preferential CUG' for an address.
        
        A CUG user subscribing to 'preferential CUG' nominates a
        CUG index which the network uses as a default to identify
        the required CUG in the absence of any CUG information
        in the outgoing call request. 
        
        A value of zero means the address does not have a 
        preferential CUG. The value of this variable must 
        correspond to a 'cwaCugIndex' of an entry in the  
        'cwaCugTable'. When an entry is created by the managed 
        system, this variable has a value of 0. 
        
        When selecting a 'preferential' CUG in the address's CUGs,
        the corresponding CUG must allow outgoing calls.  
        This means 'cwaCallsBarred'(Outgoing Calls Barred) 
        must not have a value of outgoing(2) for the corresponding
        CUG."

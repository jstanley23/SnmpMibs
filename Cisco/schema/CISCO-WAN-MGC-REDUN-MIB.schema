         Persistent events are events that call

         requesting for it. A set of events can be 
         provisioned on the Gateway as persistent  
         events. 
        
         Every event will have an action associated 
         with it, which will determine, whether to 
         be notified, ignored, accumulated etc.. 
         MGC will specify the action when  
         requesting the GW to notify the event. 
         For persistent events the Action will be 
         Notify. Call agent can change this by  
         explicitly requesting the event associating 
         an action with it.

         received a notification acknowledgement,

         MGCP 0.1 specification says if an empty signaled

         For example, if a CRCX request from the CA using MGCP

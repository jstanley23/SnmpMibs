         The index for this table is mplsInSegmentIndex.
         The index structure of this table is specifically designed
         to handle many different MPLS implementations that manage
         their labels both in a distributed and centralized manner.
         The table is also designed to handle existing MPLS labels
         as defined in RFC3031 as well as longer ones that may
         be necessary in the future.
        
         In cases where the label cannot fit into the
         mplsInSegmentLabel object, the mplsInSegmentLabelPtr
         will indicate this by being set to the first accessible
         column in the appropriate extension table's row.
         In this case an additional table MUST
         be provided and MUST be indexed by at least the indexes
         used by this table. In all other cases when the label is
         represented within the mplsInSegmentLabel object, the
         mplsInSegmentLabelPtr MUST be set to 0.0. Due to the
         fact that MPLS labels may not exceed 24 bits, the

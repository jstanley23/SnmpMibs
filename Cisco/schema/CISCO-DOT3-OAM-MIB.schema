        until an explicit management action or configuration

		readonly enum cdot3OamOperStatusE	cdot3OamOperStatus
		description 	"At initialization and failure conditions, two OAM entities on
        the same full-duplex Ethernet link begin a discovery phase to
        determine what OAM capabilities may be used on that link.  The
        progress of this initialization is controlled by the OAM
        sublayer.  
                   
        This value is always disabled(1) if OAM is disabled on this
        interface via the cdot3OamAdminState.  
        
        If the link has detected a fault and is transmitting OAMPDUs
        with a link fault indication, the value is linkFault(2). Also,
        if the interface is not operational (ifOperStatus is not 
        up(1)), linkFault(2) is returned.  Note that the object 
        ifOperStatus may not be up(1) as a result of link failure or
        administrative action (ifAdminState being down(2) or
        testing(3)).  
                         
        The passiveWait(3) state is returned only by OAM entities in
        passive mode (cdot3OamMode) and reflects the state in which the
        OAM entity is waiting to see if the peer device is OAM
        capable.  The activeSendLocal(4) value is used by active mode
        devices (cdot3OamMode) and reflects the OAM entity actively
        trying to discover whether the peer has OAM capability but has
        not yet made that determination.  
                         
        The state sendLocalAndRemote(5) reflects that the local OAM
        entity has discovered the peer but has not yet accepted or
        rejected the configuration of the peer.  The local device can,
        for whatever reason, decide that the peer device is
        unacceptable and decline OAM peering.  If the local OAM entity
        rejects the peer OAM entity, the state becomes
        oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7).  If the OAM peering is allowed
        by the local device, the state moves to
        sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6).  Note that both the
        sendLocalAndRemote(5) and oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7) states
        fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE of the Discovery state
        diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the difference being
        whether the local OAM client has actively rejected the peering
        or has just not indicated any decision yet.  Whether a peering
        decision has been made is indicated via the local flags field
        in the OAMPDU (reflected in the aOAMLocalFlagsField of
        30.3.6.1.10).  
        
        If the remote OAM entity rejects the peering, the state
        becomes oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8).  Note that both the
        sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6) and oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8)
        states fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE_OK of the
        Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the
        difference being whether the remote OAM client has rejected
        the peering or has just not yet decided.  This is indicated
        via the remote flags field in the OAM PDU (reflected in the
        aOAMRemoteFlagsField of 30.3.6.1.11).  
                         
        When the local OAM entity learns that both it and the remote
        OAM entity have accepted the peering, the state moves to
        operational(9) corresponding to the SEND_ANY state of the
        Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5].  
        
        Since Ethernet OAM functions are not designed to work
        completely over half-duplex interfaces, the value
        nonOperHalfDuplex(10) is returned whenever Ethernet OAM is
        enabled (cdot3OamAdminState is enabled(1)) but the interface is
        in half-duplex operation.  "

        Ethernet like interface.  OAM on Ethernet interfaces may be in
        'active' mode or 'passive' mode.  These two modes differ in
        that active mode provides additional capabilities to initiate
        monitoring activities with the remote OAM peer entity, while
        passive mode generally waits for the peer to initiate OAM
        actions with it.  As an example, an active OAM entity can put
        the remote OAM entity in a loopback state, where a passive OAM
        entity cannot.  
        
        The default value of cdot3OamMode is dependent on the type of
        system on which this Ethernet like interface resides.  The
        default value should be 'active(1)' unless it is known that
        this system should take on a subservient role to the other

        Changing this value results in incrementing the configuration

	table	cdot3OamEventConfigTable
	description "Ethernet OAM includes the ability to generate and receive
        Event Notification OAMPDUs to indicate various link problems.
        This table contains the mechanisms to enable Event
        Notifications and configure the thresholds to generate the
        standard Ethernet OAM events.  There is one entry in the table
        for every entry in cdot3OamTable that supports OAM events
        (where cdot3OamFunctionsSupported includes the eventSupport
        bit set). The values in the table are maintained across
        changes to cdot3OamOperStatus.  
        
        The standard threshold crossing events are:
          - Errored Symbol Period Event.  Generated when the number of
            symbol errors exceeds a threshold within a given window 
            defined by a number of symbols (for example, 1,000 symbols
            out of 1,000,000 had errors).  
          - Errored Frame Period Event.  Generated when the number of 
            frame errors exceeds a threshold within a given window 
            defined by a number of frames (for example, 10 frames out
            of 1000 had errors).  
          - Errored Frame Event.  Generated when the number of frame 
            errors exceeds a threshold within a given window defined 
            by a period of time (for example, 10 frames in 1 second 
            had errors).
          - Errored Frame Seconds Summary Event.  Generated when the 
            number of errored frame seconds exceeds a threshold within
            a given time period (for example, 10 errored frame seconds
            within the last 100 seconds).  An errored frame second is 
            defined as a 1 second interval which had >0 frame errors.  
        There are other events (dying gasp, critical events) that are
        not threshold crossing events but which can be
        enabled/disabled via this table.  "

        at the Ethernet OAM level.  These events can include locally
        detected events, which may result in locally generated
        OAMPDUs, and remotely detected events, which are detected by
        the OAM peer entity and signaled to the local entity via
        Ethernet OAM.  Ethernet OAM events can be signaled by Event
        Notification OAMPDUs or by the flags field in any OAMPDU.  
        
        This table contains both threshold crossing events and
        non-threshold crossing events.  The parameters for the
        threshold window, threshold value, and actual value
        (cdot3OamEventLogWindowXX, cdot3OamEventLogThresholdXX,
        cdot3OamEventLogValue) are only applicable to threshold
        crossing events, and are returned as all F's (2^32 - 1) for
        non-threshold crossing events.  
        Entries in the table are automatically created when such
        events are detected.  The size of the table is implementation
        dependent.  When the table reaches its maximum size, older
        entries are automatically deleted to make room for newer

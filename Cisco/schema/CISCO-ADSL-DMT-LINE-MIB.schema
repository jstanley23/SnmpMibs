		description 	"This object specifies whether the ATU-C performs bitswapping.
        Bitswapping attempts to maintain an acceptable margin for
        each bin; equalizing the margin across all bins through bit
        reallocation, thereby maximizing error performance.
        
        The ATU-C performs bitswapping by monitoring the margin
        measured for each bin by the transmitter:
        
        1)  If a bin's margin falls below 'target' and the difference,
            between the margin and 'target' exceeds 'thresh(f)', then
            the ATU-C marks the bin as a 'from' bin.
        
        2)  If a bin's margin exceeds 'target' and the difference
            between the margin and 'target' exceeds 'thresh(t)', then
            the ATU-C marks the bin as a 'to' bin.

                'thresh(t)' = cAdslAtucDmtConfBitSwapTo
        
        The ATU-C attempts to equalize the margin across the bins by
        swapping bits out of bins marked 'from' into bins marked 'to'.
        When the ATU-C swaps a bit out of bin, it decreases its b(i).
        Thus, the bins constellation is smaller, which increases its
        margin.  When the ATU-C swaps a bit into a bin, it increases
        its b(i).  Thus, the bins constellation is larger, which
        decreases its margin.
        
        In addition, the ATU-R may optionally implement its own
        monitoring capability.  The ATU-R uses this information to
        request the ATU-C to perform bitswapping.  When this object
        is 'true', the ATU-C must be prepared to accept and properly
        handle bitswap requests from the ATU-R.
        
        While bitswapping has its obvious advantages, bitswapping can
        have undesirable side effects.  It can introduce errors on
        lines prone to impulse noise.  In this case, it may be desirable
        to disable bitswapping."

        then the ATU-C may not identify an adequate number of bins
        that it can swap bits 'to', thereby decreasing the chances
        for the ATU-C to equalize the margin across all the bins.

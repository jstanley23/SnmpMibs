        a device would implement the igmpV2RouterMIBGroup only on

		description 	"The Robustness Variable allows tuning for the expected
        packet loss on a subnet.  If a subnet is expected to be

        inserted into Group-Specific Queries sent in response to
        Leave Group messages, and is also the amount of time between
        Group-Specific Query messages.  This value may be tuned to
        modify the leave latency of the network.  A reduced value
        results in reduced time to detect the loss of the last
        member of a group.  The value of this object is irrelevant
        if igmpInterfaceVersion is 1."

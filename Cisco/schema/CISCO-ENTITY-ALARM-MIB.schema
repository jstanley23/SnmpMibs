        alarm type.
        
        An implementation may chose to not allow dynamic severity
        assignment, in which case it would restrict access to this
        object to be read-only.
        
        If an implementation allows dynamic severity assignment, then
        a management client can revert to the default severity by
        writing the value '0' to this object.
        
        There exists a class of systems that should implement dynamic
        severity assignment.  For example, consider a DSLAM (Digital
        Subscriber Loop Access Multiplexor) designed for both the
        central office and pedestal environments.  A 'pedestal' is
        typically a dark-green metal box mounted on a concrete or stone
        foundation in which carrier-class companies house equipment.
        The central office typically controls the temperature and
        humidity of the environment, reducing reliance on a system's
        fans.  Thus, the customer probably has a desire to reduce the 
        severity of alarms indicating the failure of a fan.  However, a
        pedestal environment has a much greater reliance on a system's
        fans.  Thus, the customer probably has a desire to increase the
        severity of alarms indicating the failure of a fan."

                        alarm exists.
        
            'cleared'   Indicates that the condition described by the
                        alarm does not exist.
        
        For example, a slot in a chassis may define an alarm that
        specifies whether the slot contains a module.  At the time of
        module insertion, the physical entity corresponding to the slot
        asserts this alarm, and the alarm remains asserted until the 
        slot becomes empty.
        
        If an alarm is being asserted by the physical entity, then the
        corresponding bit in the alarm list is set to a one. Observe

        alarms, then the list will have a length of zero."

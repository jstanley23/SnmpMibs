               Setting this object to noReset(1) has no effect.
               The agent will always return the value noReset(1)
               when this object is read.

               After receiving a request to set this variable to
               reset(2), the agent is allowed to delay the reset
               for a short period.  For example, the implementor
               may choose to delay the reset long enough to allow
               the SNMP response to be transmitted.  In any
               event, the SNMP response must be transmitted.

               the repeater but without affecting management
               information about the repeater.  c) The test does
               not inject packets onto any segment.  d) Packets
               received during the test may or may not be
               transferred.  e) The test does not interfere with
               management functions.

               After performing this self-test, the agent will
               update the repeater health information (including
               rptrOperStatus and rptrHealthText), and send a

               packets onto any segment.  d) The test does not
               prevent the relay of any packets.  e) The test
               does not interfere with management functions.

        for transmission (that is, in BER, not ASN.1) as an integer.
        
        For 'existence', the specific test is as selected by
        mteTriggerExistenceTest.  When an object appears, vanishes
        or changes value, the trigger fires. If the object's
        appearance caused the trigger firing, the object MUST
        vanish before the trigger can be fired again for it, and
        vice versa. If the trigger fired due to a change in the
        object's value, it will be fired again on every successive
        value change for that object.
        
        For 'boolean', the specific test is as selected by
        mteTriggerBooleanTest.  If the test result is true the trigger
        fires.  The trigger will not fire again until the value has
        become false and come back to true.
        
        For 'threshold' the test works as described below for
        
        mteTriggerThresholdStartup, mteTriggerThresholdRising, and

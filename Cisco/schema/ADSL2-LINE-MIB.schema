	table	adsl2SCStatusTable
	description "The table adsl2SCStatusTable contains status parameters
        of the ADSL2 sub-carriers.  The following points apply to this
        table:
        1.  The main purpose of this table is to hold the results
            of a DELT.
        2.  This table also holds parameters obtained at line
            initialization time.
        3.  The rows in this table are volatile; that is, they are
            lost if the SNMP agent is rebooted.
        4.  Due to the large OCTET STRING attributes in this table,
            the worst case memory requirements for this table are
            very high.  The manager may use the row status attribute
            of this table to delete rows in order to reclaim memory.
        5.  The manager may create rows in this table.  The SNMP
            agent may create rows in this table.  Only the manager
            may delete rows in this table.
        6.  The maximum number of rows allowable in this table is
            indicated by the scalar attribute
            adsl2ScalarSCMaxInterfaces.
            The number of rows available in this table is indicated
            by the scalar attribute adsl2ScalarSCAvailInterfaces.
        7.  The SNMP agent is permitted to create rows in this table
            when a DELT completes successfully or when line
            initialization occurs.  It is not mandatory for the SNMP
            agent to create rows in this table; hence, it may be
            necessary for the manager to create rows in this table
            before any results can be stored.
        8.  If the manager attempts to create a row in this table
            and there are no more rows available, the creation
            attempt will fail, and the response to the SNMP SET PDU
            will contain the error noCreation(11).
        9.  If the SNMP agent attempts to create a row in this table
            and there are no more rows available, the creation
            attempt will fail, and the attribute
            adsl2LineCmndConfLdsfFailReason will indicate the
            reason for the failure.  The failure reason will be either
            tableFull(10) or noResources(11).
        10. An example of use of this table is as follows:
            Step 1. : The DELT is started by setting the
                    : adsl2LineCmndConfLdsf from inhibit to force.
            Step 2. : The DELT completes, and valid data is
                    : available.
            Step 3. : The row in the adsl2SCStatusTable where the
                    : results will be stored does not yet exist so
                    : the SNMP agent attempts to create the row.
            Step 4. : Due to a low memory condition, a row in the
                    : adsl2SCStatusTable table cannot be created at
                    : this time.
            Step 5. : The reason for the failure, tableFull(10), is
                    : indicated in the adsl2LineCmndConfLdsfFailReason
                    : attribute.
        11. Another example of use of this table is as follows :
            Step 1. : The DELT is started by setting the
                    : adsl2LineCmndConfLdsf from inhibit to force.
            Step 2. : The DELT completes and valid data is
                    : available.
            Step 3. : The row in the adsl2SCStatusTable where the
                    : results will be stored does not yet exist so
                    : the SNMP agent attempts to create the row.
            Step 4. : The row creation is successful.
            Step 5. : The value of the attribute
                    : adsl2LineCmndConfLdsfFailReasonreason is set
                    : to success(2).
        12. Another example of use of this table is as follows:
            Step 1. : The manager creates a row in adsl2SCStatusTable
                    : for a particular ADSL2 line.
            Step 2. : The DELT is started on the above-mentioned
                    : line by setting the adsl2LineCmndConfLdsf from
                    : inhibit to force.
            Step 3. : The DELT completes, and valid data is
                    : available.
            Step 4. : The value of the attribute
                    : adsl2LineCmndConfLdsfFailReasonreason is set

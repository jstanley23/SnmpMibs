## Group and Table Declarations

	table	cFcSdvVirtDeviceTable
	description "This table lists all the virtual devices configured
         on this device.
        
         The successful creation of a row in this table,
         through the use of the cFCSDMVdRowStatus object,
         followed by the 'Config Commit' will also cause
         the creation of rows in other tables. Specifically:
        
         - The Creation of Device Alias: An entry in the
          'cfdaConfigTable' of CISCO-FC-DEVICE-ALIAS-MIB
           gets created by the agent with the value of the 
           cFcSdvVdName as the instance identifier value of
           cfdaConfigDeviceAlias, 'pwwn' as the value of 
           cfdaConfigDeviceType and the value of cFcSdvVdPwwn
           as the value of cfdaConfigDeviceId. An attempt
           to create an already existing Device Alias entry
           mapping to different Real Device would fail and
           hence results in failure to add Virtual Device
           entry in this table. In general, any failure in
           Device Alias creation/deletion will have 
           corresponding effect of Virtual Device creation
           /deletion respectively.
            
         Similarly the deletion of a row in this table causes
         deletion of corresponding rows in other tables. 
         Specifically:
         
         - An entry in the 'cfdaConfigTable' of  
           CISCO-FC-DEVICE-ALIAS-MIB that corresponding to
           the value of cFcSdvVdName is deleted.
        
         Once a Virtual Device gets created successfully,
         such a device is available for zone configuration.
         The Virtual Device added as Device Alias can be 
         used to create the zones and zoneSets using
         CISCO-ZS-MIB. The Device Alias is identified as
         the 'deviceAlias' type of ZoneMemberType in all
         occurrences of usage of ZoneMemberType in the 
         zoning tables."

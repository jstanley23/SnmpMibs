		description 	"An object to turn APPN notification generation on and off.
        Setting a notification type's bit to 1 enables generation of
        notifications of that type, subject to further filtering
        resulting from entries in the snmpNotificationMIB.  Setting
        this bit to 0 disables generation of notifications of that
        type.
        
        Note that generation of the appnIsrAccountingDataTrap is
        controlled by the appnIsInGlobeCtrAdminStatus object in
        the APPN MIB:  if counts of intermediate session traffic
        are being kept at all, then the notification is also enabled."

## Group and Table Declarations

	table	cippfIpProfileTable
	description "This table lists all the existing IP protocol 
        filter profiles.  These filter profiles contain 
        protocol filters used to filter IP traffic 
        through the device interfaces.  The IP protocol 
        filters associated with these profiles are 
        defined in the cippfIpFilterTable.  
        
        For profiles to be associated with filters, the 
        object value of the cippfIpProfileName of a 
        profile must matches that of the cippfIpProfileName
        of a filter entry in the cippfIpFilterTable.
        Filters of the same profile name belong to a
        common filter profile and are of the same usage
        type of the profile.
        
        This table can only be used to create or delete
        filter profiles.  Deleting any profile in this
        table will also delete all the associated filters
        in the cippfIpFilterTable and cause the state of
        the associated 'active' filter profile in the
        cippfIfIpProfileTable to be changed to 'notReady'.  
        All of these deleted or changed entries are 
        associated by virtue of the same profile name."

	table	cippfIpFilterTable
	description "This table contains ordered lists of filters for 
        all the IP protocol filter profiles.  Device traffic
        filtering system applies filters of a filter profile 
        according to the filter order position.  IP packets 
        matching any filter will be processed according to 
        the matching action specified by the filter or they
        will be discarded if they do not match any filters.  
        
        Any IP packet through an interface can theoretically
        match multiple filters or rows of this table of the 
        same filter profile.  When applying a filter to a 
        packet, the cippfIfIpProfileTable is used to first
        identify the filter profile to use, then this table 
        is scanned according to filter profile name and 
        filter order position.  If the packet matches all 
        criteria for that row, the action defined in the 
        cippfIpFilterAction object of the row will be taken.  
        
        If the action for the matching filter is deny(1), 
        the packet is discarded and the processing is 
        completed.  If the action for the matching filter is
        permit(2), the packet is accepted and permitted to 
        be processed by the bridging or routing logic.  If 
        the packet matches no filter in this table, the 
        packet is always deny(1) and will be dropped.
        
        To create a filter, the cippfIpProfileName must
        already exists in the cippfIpProfileTable. No filter
        can be created without an existing filter in the 
        cippfIpProfileTable.  If the filter profile is 
        deleted from the cippfIpProfileTable, all the 
        associated filters in this table will also be

        corresponding profile in this table.

        must match the index of an existing 'active' filter

		readwrite gauge	cippfIpFilterOrderPosition
		description 	"This object is used to order the IP protocol filters
        within a filter profile.  The filter with the lowest
        order position number is applied first, that is 
        cippfIpFilterOrderPosition '1'.  The order position 
        number among all filters of a profile is always 
        consecutive.  The agent will automatically arrange 
        the order position to a consecutive manner for the 
        filter entries within the profile after each addition
        (when the created entry moves to 'active' state) and 
        modification or deletion (when the active entry moves
        out from 'active' state) of any filter.
        
        For example, a new filter is added to an empty
        profile with the cippfIpFilterOrderPosition '2' , 
        the filter will be actually positioned to 
        cippfIpFilterOrderPosition '1' by the agent. 
        Moreover, if there are 3 filters in the profile 
        and their order positions are 1, 2, and 3.  Adding 
        a new filter with any cippfIpFilterOrderPosition 
        greater than '3' will produce the same effect.  The 
        new filter will actually be in position '4' because 
        the agent maintains the filters in consecutive order.
        
        When a filter is removed from a profile, the filters
        following this filter will be moved forward and 
        decrement their order position numbers.  For example, 
        if there are 6 filters in the profile and their 
        order positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.  Deleting
        the filter of cippfIpFilterOrderPosition '4' will
        cause the existing filters of 
        cippfIpFilterOrderPosition '5' and '6' to change
        to '4' and '5' respectively.
        
        When a filter is added to the order position of an
        existing filter of the same profile, the existing
        filter entry and all subsequent entries following it
        will increment their cippfIpFilterOrderPosition.  
        This essentially move the existing filters towards
        the end of the filter profile.  
        
        For example, if there are 6 filters in the profile, 
        and their cippfIpFilterOrderPosition values are 1, 
        2, 3, 4, 5, 6.  If the user would like to add a new
        one and specifies '4' to be the 
        cippfIpFilterOrderPosition of the new filter, the 
        existing filters of cippfIpFilterOrderPosition
        values 4, 5, 6 will become 5, 6, 7.  
        
        The cippfIpFilterOrderPosition value '0' is a
        special number meaning to append the filter
        to the last filter of the profile. Continue with
        our previous example, if another new filter is added
        and the user specifies the cippfIpFilterOrderPosition 
        to be '0'.  The new filter will actually be created  
        with cippfIpFilterOrderPosition equal to 8.  
        
        Finally, moving a filter within a profile will have 
        the same effect of first deleting and then adding the 
        filter to the new position.  For example, if the 
        filter of cippfIpFilterOrderPosition 2 is moved to 4,
        the filters originally at the 
        cippfIpFilterOrderPosition 3 and 4 will be moved 
        forward to 2 and 3 respectively and filters of all 
        other cippfIpFilterOrderPosition values will remain 
        unchanged."

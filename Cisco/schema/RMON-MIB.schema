        This object can be used as a reasonable estimate of

        desired, the etherStatsPkts and etherStatsOctets objects
        should be sampled before and after a common interval.  The
        differences in the sampled values are Pkts and Octets,
        respectively, and the number of seconds in the interval is
        Interval.  These values are used to calculate the Utilization
        as follows:

		readonly counter	etherStatsCollisions
		description 	"The best estimate of the total number of collisions
        on this Ethernet segment.
        
        The value returned will depend on the location of the
        RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section
        10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a
        station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if
        three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously.  A
        repeater port must detect a collision when two or more
        stations are transmitting simultaneously.  Thus a probe
        placed on a repeater port could record more collisions
        than a probe connected to a station on the same segment
        would.
        
        Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering
        10BASE-T.  14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3
        defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals
        on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving
        at the same time).  A 10BASE-T station can only detect
        collisions when it is transmitting.  Thus probes placed on
        a station and a repeater, should report the same number of
        collisions.
        
        Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should
        ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or
        more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE
        802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax
        segments to which the repeater is connected."

        RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section
        10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a
        station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if
        three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously.  A
        repeater port must detect a collision when two or more
        stations are transmitting simultaneously.  Thus a probe

        than a probe connected to a station on the same segment

        Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering

        defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals
        on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving
        at the same time).  A 10BASE-T station can only detect
        collisions when it is transmitting.  Thus probes placed on
        a station and a repeater, should report the same number of
        collisions.
        
        Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should
        ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or
        more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE
        802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax

        The only bits relevant to this match algorithm are those that
        have the corresponding filterPktStatusMask bit equal to one.
        The following two rules are then applied to every packet:
        
        (1) For each relevant bit from the packet status with the
            corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to zero, if
            the bit from the packet status is not equal to the
            corresponding bit from the filterPktStatus, then the
            packet will fail this status match.
        
        (2) If for every relevant bit from the packet status with the
            corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to one, the
            bit from the packet status is equal to the corresponding
            bit from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail
            this status match.
        
        Any packets that have not failed either of the two matches
        above have passed this status match.  In particular, a zero
        length status filter will match any packet's status.
        
        The value of the packet status is a sum.  This sum
        initially takes the value zero.  Then, for each
        error, E, that has been discovered in this packet,
        2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum.
        The errors and the bits that represent them are dependent
        on the media type of the interface that this channel
        is receiving packets from.
        
        The errors defined for a packet captured off of an
        Ethernet interface are as follows:
        
            bit #    Error
                0    Packet is longer than 1518 octets
                1    Packet is shorter than 64 octets
                2    Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment error
        
        For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a
        value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2).
        
        As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this object
        will have other media-specific errors defined.
        
        For the purposes of this status matching algorithm, if the
        packet status is longer than this filterPktStatus object,
        this object is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it
        reaches the size of the packet status.

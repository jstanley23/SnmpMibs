        This counter is used by the NMS to determine if a connection

        This functionality is conventionally achieved by time 
        stamping using a time-of-day clock. However, in switches

        The upload counter is incremented, when:
        
        * assignment of connection to an end point channel. This
        happens when a connection is added and assigned this

        that is associated with this end point channel number.
        
        In a new system, an unutilised resouce (channel number)
        has a counter value of zero. When a connection is added to
        this channel end point, the counter is incremented. And is
        incremented for any of the above operations. When a connection
        is deleted the value of this counter is incremented and

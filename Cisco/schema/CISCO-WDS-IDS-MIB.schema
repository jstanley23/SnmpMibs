	table	ciscoWdsIdsMacSpoofTable
	description "This table gives the information about the MAC 
        spoofing attacks detected by the network entity
        offering WDS.
        
        An entry in this table is created by the agent when
        the WDS detects a MAC spoofing attack.  
        
        The agent at anytime will retain only the most
        recent and maximum number of entries possible
        for a particular MAC.  The older entries are
        purged automatically when the number of entries
        for a particular MAC reaches its maximum.
        Thus, there can be a maximum of those many
        different MAC addresses indicated by 
        ciscoWdsIdsMaxMacAddresses and for each MAC
        address, the maximum number of entries is
        indicated by the value of the MIB object
        ciscoWdsIdsMaxEntriesPerMac. 
        
        MAC spoofing is detected only by the network entity
        serving as the active WDS and hence this table
        is populated only by the active WDS as indicated
        by the values 'wds' and 'active' for the MIB objects
        cDot11csServiceType and cDot11csWdsInstanceState
        respectively.  If cDot11csServiceType equals 'none'
        indicating that WDS is not configured in this
        station, or cDot11csWdsInstanceState not equals
        'active' indicating that this entity is not the
        currently active WDS, a 'noSuchInstance' error
        is returned for the queries to the objects of this
        table. "

        is used if the object is not applicable, for example when 
        mapping all packets from an Ethernet port to this VC. 
        The value of 4096 is used to indicate untagged frames (at  
        least from the PW point of view), for example if  
        cpwVcEnetVlanMode is equal 'removeVLAN' or when

        - 'removeVlan' indicates that the encapsulation on the  
          VC does not include the original VLAN field. Note  
          that PRI bits transparency is lost in this case. 
        
        - 'addVlan' indicate that a VLAN field will be added

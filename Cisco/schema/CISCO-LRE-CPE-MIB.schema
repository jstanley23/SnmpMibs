## Group and Table Declarations

	table	clreCpeDot1dTpFdbTable
	description "A table that supplements the information from the BRIDGE-MIB.
        The BRIDGE-MIB tracks the MAC address to switch interface 
        mapping in the dot1dTpFdbTable. On the long reach ethernet 
        switch, CPE devices connect to the switch interfaces. Each 
        CPE device has one or more ports. This table maps a 
        MAC address on the switch to an interface associated with a 
        CPE port."

		description 	"The value of the instance of the ifIndex object,
        define in MIB-II, for the interface corresponding 
        to this CPE port. The Forwarding database on the 
        switch tracks a MAC address and its associated
        switch interface in the dot1dTpFdbTable table. 
        This object adds information about which port 
        on the CPE the MAC address was learnt on."

	table	clreCpePortTable
	description "A list of LRE CPE port entries. The number of entries is 
        determined by the number of Long Reach Ethernet interfaces 
        (to which the CPE attaches) on the switch and the number 
        of Fast Ethernet ports each CPE supports."

        state indicates that no operational packets can be
        passed.  When a managed system initializes, all
        CPE ports start with clreCpePortAdminStatus in 
        the down(2) state.  As a result of either explicit 
        management action or per configuration information 
        retained by the managed system, clreCpePortAdminStatus
        is then changed to either the up(1) or testing(3) states

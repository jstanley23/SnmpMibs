		readonly octet[255]	ipSecPolMapAclString
		description 	"The value of this object is the number or
        the name of the access control string (ACL) 
        that caused this IPSec tunnel to be established. 
        The ACL that causes an IPSec tunnel
        to be established is referenced by the 
        cryptomap of the tunnel.
        
        The ACL identifies the traffic that requires
        protection as defined by the policy.
        
        For instance, the ACL that requires FTP
        traffic between local subnet 172.16.14.0 and a
        remote subnet 172.16.16.0 to be protected
        is defined as
        
         ==>access-list 101 permit tcp 172.16.14.0 0.0.0.255
                          172.16.16.0 0.0.0.255 eq ftp
        
         When this command causes an IPSec tunnel to be
        established, the object 'ipSecPolMapAclString'
        assumes the string value '101'.
        
         If the ACL is a named list such as
        ==> ip access-list standard myAcl
        permit 172.16.16.8 0.0.0.0
        
         then the value of this MIB element corresponding to 
        IPSec tunnel that was created by this ACL would
        be 'myAcl'."

		readonly octet[255]	ipSecPolMapAceString
		description 	"The value of this object is the access control 
        entry (ACE) within the ACL that caused this IPSec 
        tunnel to be established. 
        
        For instance, if an ACL defines access for two
        traffic streams (FTP and SNMP) as follows:
        
         access-list 101 permit tcp 172.16.14.0 0.0.0.255
                          172.16.16.0 0.0.0.255 eq ftp

                          host 172.16.16.1 eq 161
        
        
        When associated with an IPSec policy, the second
        element of the ACL gives rise to an IPSec tunnel
        in the wake of SNMP traffic. The value of the
        object 'ipSecPolMapAceString' for the IPSec tunnel
        would be then the string
         'access-list 101 permit udp 172.16.14.0 0.0.0.255
                          host 172.16.16.1 eq 161'"

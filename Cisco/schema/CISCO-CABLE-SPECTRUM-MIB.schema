		description 	"Defines the criteria that trigger a change in
        frequency hopping, modulation or channel width.  
        
        Depending on the type of linecards, the criteria 
        are slightly different:
        
        For the linecards that have no Hardware 
        Based Spectrum Management capability like 
        the uBR-MC1xC, change in modulation or frequency
        occurs in the following criteria:
        
        1) Change from modulation profile 1 to 
           modulation profile 2 would occur when CMTS 
           detects the SNR that goes below the 
           threshold and either corr FEC or uncorr FEC 
           is above the threshold.  In this case, 
           snrBelowThres and either corrFecAboveThres or 
           uncorrFecAboveThres bits will get set. 
        
        2) Change from modulation profile 2 to 
           modulation profile 1 would occur when CMTS 
           detects the SNR goes above the threshold+3
           and both corr FEC and uncorr FEC are 
           below the threshold.  In this case, 
           snrAboveThres and corrFecBelowThres
           and uncorrFecBelowThres bits will get set. 
        
        3) Change in frequency or frequency hopping would
           occur when CMTS detects no active modem on the link.  
           In this case, noActiveModem bit will get
           set accordingly.
        
        
        For the linecards that have the Hardware Based 
        Spectrum Management capability, change in 
        frequency, modulation or channel width occurs 
        in the following criteria:
        
        1) when CMTS detects the SNR or CNR goes below the 
           threshold and either corr FEC or uncorr FEC is 
           above the threshold.  In this case, 
           either snrBelowThres or cnrBelowThres and 
           either corrFecAboveThres or uncorrFecAboveThres 
           bits will get set. 
        
        2) when CMTS detects the SNR or CNR goes above the 
           threshold + 3 and both corr FEC and uncorr FEC are 
           below the threshold.  In this case, 
           either snrAboveThres or cnrAboveThres and both 
           corrFecBelowThres and uncorrFecBelowThres bits 
           will get set. 
        
        3) when CMTS detects no active modem on the link or 
           uncorr FEC is above ccsUpSpecMgmtFecUnCorrectThres2. 
           In this case noActiveModem or 
           uncorrFecAboveSecondThres bit will get set 
           accordingly.
        
        Note: The order of frequency, modulation or channel 
        width changes for the advanced spectrum management
        linecards will be determined based on the selection of 
        the ccsUpSpecMgmtHopPriority."

         operation of OSCP over wavelengths that terminate at this

         control aggregation of multiple wavelengths that terminate
         at the same remote switch.

         dedicated wavelength should be terminated on the switch

         A link type of 'inBand' represents a message channel used
         to carry control and management traffic on a wavelength

		description 	"This object indicates the state of the Hello protocol 
         exchange over this link.
        
         The 'down' state is the initial state of the OSCP Hello
         finite state machine. This state is also reached when
         lower-level protocols declare that the wavelength is not
         usable. No hello packets are sent or received in this
         state.
        
         The 'attempt' state indicates that either no hellos or
         hellos with mismatch information have recently been
         received from the remote switch. In this state, attempts
         are made to contact the remote switch by periodically
         sending hellos with period coscpHelloInterval.
        
         The 'oneWay' state indicates that Hellos have recently
         been received from the remote switch, but the remote
         switch identifier and the remote port identifier in the
         remote switch's hello packets were set to zero. This means
         that the remote switch does not know the identity of this
         switch.
        
         The 'twoWay' state indicates that hellos have recently
         been received from the remote switch including the
         correct remote switch identifier and remote port
         identifier fields. This means that bi-directional
         communication with the remote switch over the message
         channel on this wavelength has been achieved. The link is
         now capable of becoming the active OSC for a wavelength
         bundle.
        
         A link that is not in the 'twoWay' state is not capable of
         becoming the active OSC for a wavelength bundle."

		readonly gauge	coscpLinkDerivedBundleId
		description 	"This object identifies the wavelength bundle to the remote
         switch that this link belongs to. All links with the same
         value of coscpLinkRemoteSwitchId and the same value of
         this object are aggregated and treated as a single logical
         link with a single control channel. The aggregated logical
         link that contains this link is shown in coscpBundleTable
         as the coscpBundleEntry with coscpBundleRemoteSwitchId
         value equal to the value of coscpLinkRemoteSwitchId and
         with coscpBundleId value equal to the value of this
         object.
        
         The value of this object is derived from the bundle
         identifier advertised by this switch in the OSCP
         (specified in coscpLinkConfigBundleId) and the bundle
         identifier advertised by the remote switch. The two
         switches on either end of the link run the same algorithm
         on the same information to determine common values of the
         derived bundle identifier. The derivation process is
         intended for minimal configuration as well as acceptable
         behavior in the face of misconfiguration.
        
         By default all links have the coscpLinkConfigBundleId
         value zero. Since all links have the same default value,
         the default behavior is to aggregate all links between two
         switches into a single logical link with derived bundle
         identifier value zero.
        
         In order to assign a non-default bundle identifier to a
         link between two switches, only one side needs to be
         configured with the non-default value. The
         coscpLinkConfigBundleId value zero indicates that the
         switch will use as the derived bundle identifier value
         whatever value the remote switch has.
        
         The algorithm for computing the value of the derived
         bundle identifier is:
         1. If the two switches exchange identical values of the
            configured bundle identifier, that value becomes the
            derived bundle identifier.
         2. If the configured bundle identifier value of one of the
            switches is zero and that of the other switch is
            non-zero, the non-zero value becomes the derived bundle
            identifier value.
         3. If the configured bundle identifier values of the two
            switches are different and both non-zero, the link has
            been misconfigured and the derived bundle identifier
            value becomes zero."

         coscpLinkDerivedBundleId according to the algorithm
         presented in the description of the
         coscpLinkDerivedBundleId.
        
         By default all links have the value zero. Since all links
         have the same default value, the default behavior is to

This is the trap definition directory.  The files located in this 
directory list traps that are supported by cisco products.

Files that end in the .trap extension are SunNet Manager (SNM) trap
definition files.  They should be added to the snmp.trap file normally
found in /var/adm/snm.

The following is a list of directories which are in this directory.
The file you're reading is the one named "README", in directory
pub/mibs/traps.
